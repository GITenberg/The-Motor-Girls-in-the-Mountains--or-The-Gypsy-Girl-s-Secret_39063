<h2>THE MOTOR GIRLS
<br /><span class="small">IN THE MOUNTAINS</span></h2>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">BREAKING THE SPEED LIMIT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Say, girls, isn&rsquo;t this the best thing ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora Kimball, the girl whose hand was on the
wheel of the motor car as it sped swiftly along a
sun-flecked country road, put the words in the
form of a question, but they were really an exclamation
drawn from her by sheer delight in
living. She was gloriously indifferent as to an
answer, but the answer came just the same from
the two pretty girls who occupied the seat behind
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly grand!&rdquo; cried Belle Robinson,
the more slender of the two, as she snuggled down
still more luxuriously in the soft cushions of the
automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me yet as though it must be a
dream,&rdquo; declared her twin sister Bess, who was
considerably larger than either of her companions.
&ldquo;Pinch me, somebody, so that I can be sure it&rsquo;s
real.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>Cora reached over mischievously and took her
at her word.</p>
<p>Bess drew back with a little squeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You took a piece out
that time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what if I did?&rdquo; laughed Cora. &ldquo;You
can spare a little without missing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be thankful to Cora for helping
you to reduce,&rdquo; put in her sister slyly.</p>
<p>Bess flushed a trifle, for her &ldquo;plumpness&rdquo;&mdash;she
abominated the word &ldquo;stout&rdquo; and avoided it as if
it were the plague&mdash;was rather a tender point
with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for such drastic methods,&rdquo; she
retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather take the flesh off more gradually.
Besides,&rdquo; she added with a show of pride,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down quite fast enough as it is. I&rsquo;m
two pounds lighter than I was last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell chance you have of getting thinner when
you will keep nibbling at chocolate creams,&rdquo; remarked
her sister unbelievingly. &ldquo;You might
hand some over, you stingy thing, instead of keeping
them all to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing!&rdquo; denied Bess, producing a
small box. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re lemon drops, and everybody
knows <i>they</i> don&rsquo;t make you&rdquo;&mdash;she was going to
say &ldquo;fat,&rdquo; but checked herself just in time to substitute
&ldquo;plump.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Slip one into my mouth, Belle,&rdquo; commanded
Cora. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare to take my hand from the
wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed that you took it away fast enough
when you wanted to pinch me,&rdquo; remarked Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was different,&rdquo; returned Cora. &ldquo;You
asked me to, and I&rsquo;d do a good deal to oblige a
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven save me from my friends,&rdquo; sighed
Bess, and then they all laughed.</p>
<p>For laughter came easy on a day like this. The
sun of early August was tempered by a light
breeze that removed any suspicion of sultriness.
The road was a good one, and Cora&rsquo;s car under
her expert guidance glided along with scarcely
a jar. Great trees on either side provided
a grateful shade. Squirrels scolded noisily in
the branches, and here and there a chipmunk
slipped like a shadow along the fences and the
hum of the locusts filled the air with a dreamy
harmony. A bobolink flitted across the road,
dropping a whole sheaf of silver notes from his
joyous throat. It was a day on which it was good
to be alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think that we&rsquo;re really on our way to the
Adirondacks,&rdquo; murmured Belle delightedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
wanted to go there ever since I wore pigtails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to Camp Kill Kare,&rdquo; said Bess. &ldquo;The
very name seems to promise all kinds of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; agreed Cora. &ldquo;And how much
more fun it is to go this way than in stuffy old
railway cars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure we can get there by to-morrow
night?&rdquo; asked Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can if nothing happens to the car,&rdquo; answered
Cora. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in splendid shape now, and
we&rsquo;re fairly eating up the miles. Of course, if it
rains and the roads get muddy it may take us a
little longer. But after all the rain we had last
week, I guess we can be sure of good weather.
There isn&rsquo;t a cloud in the sky now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you finally decide to stay at your Aunt
Margaret&rsquo;s house to-night?&rdquo; asked Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Cora. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it lucky that her
home is just about half-way on our trip? If it
hadn&rsquo;t been for that, we&rsquo;d have had to bring a
chaperon along with us, and that would have been
a nuisance. I suppose they are a necessary evil,
but I&rsquo;m awfully glad when we get a chance to do
without one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your Aunt Betty will be at Kill Kare
when we get there,&rdquo; remarked Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s already there,&rdquo; answered Cora. &ldquo;We
got a letter from her yesterday, saying that everything
was all ready for us and that she was just
dying to see us. And with Aunt Betty in mind,
I&rsquo;ll take back what I said about chaperons. She&rsquo;s
a perfect dear, and I&rsquo;m sure you girls will fall
dead in love with her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt we shall,&rdquo; answered Bess. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
prepared to love her just from your description.
But say, girls,&rdquo; she continued, glancing at her
wrist watch, &ldquo;do you know that it&rsquo;s after twelve
o&rsquo;clock? Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;d better be looking
about for some place to stop to get lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear that girl talk!&rdquo; mocked Cora. &ldquo;And
she&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s always talking about reducing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that this too, too solid flesh might melt,&rdquo;
quoted Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the truth were known, I&rsquo;ll wager I don&rsquo;t eat
as much as either of you two,&rdquo; retorted Bess. &ldquo;I
had only a cup of coffee and two rolls this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had more than two rolls,&rdquo; declared Belle,
&ldquo;I counted them and there were at least ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Belle Robinson?&rdquo; asked
Bess, turning to her sister in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rolls on the floor, I mean,&rdquo; explained Belle,
&ldquo;when you were going through your reducing exercises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bess turned her eyes to heaven in mute appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own sister giving me away!&rdquo; she moaned.
&ldquo;Well, our relatives are wished on us, but thank
goodness I can choose my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop your scrapping, girls,&rdquo; interposed Cora,
&ldquo;and listen to me. There isn&rsquo;t any hotel in sight,
and even if there were, who wants to go indoors
on a day like this? Mary put up a splendid lunch
before we started. What&rsquo;s the matter with dining
<i>al fresco</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the girl!&rdquo; exclaimed Belle. &ldquo;What
does she mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds to me like a sleight of hand performer,&rdquo;
murmured Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of &lsquo;presto change,&rsquo;&rdquo; laughed
Cora. &ldquo;No, my benighted sisters. To put the
thing in terms that your limited intelligence can
grasp, I meant that we would eat in the open air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here in the car?&rdquo; asked Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we could,&rdquo; answered Cora; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t
you think it would be better yet to find some nice
little place by the side of the road? I&rsquo;m a little
cramped from sitting so long, and I suppose you
are too. It will do us good to have a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s choose some place where there&rsquo;s a brook
or a spring,&rdquo; suggested Bess. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreadfully
thirsty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been eating too many lemon drops,&rdquo; said
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more than you,&rdquo; retorted Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But, gracious, that&rsquo;s too many,&rdquo; sighed
her sister. &ldquo;Less candy and more sandwiches for
me when we are in the open air like this! Come,
where&rsquo;s that brook?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt we can find such a place,&rdquo; observed
Cora, as she put a little extra speed in the
car. &ldquo;You girls keep your eyes open and tell me
when to stop. I&rsquo;ve got all I can do to watch the
road and save some dog or chicken from untimely
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not many minutes had elapsed before Belle
reached over and touched Cora&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very spot!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
brook and some trees that were just intended for
a picnic party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora guided the car to the side of the road.
The girls got out and stretched their cramped
limbs with a sigh of relief. The lunch basket was
taken from beneath the seat and carried to a cool
and shady spot beneath a clump of great trees that
stood a few feet away from the road. From a
brook that rippled over the stones with a musical
murmur, they brought a supply of water. A robe
from the car was spread out on the grass, and
napkins from the basket served as miniature tablecloths.</p>
<p>Then Mary&rsquo;s offerings were brought to light,
and amply maintained that person&rsquo;s reputation for
culinary skill. Lettuce sandwiches, hard-boiled
eggs, fried chicken legs, lemon tarts and fruit followed
each other in rapid succession. Then, too,
there was a thermos bottle filled with hot, fragrant
coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>Their morning in the open air had sharpened
the appetites of the girls, and they ate with a zest
that would have made a dyspeptic turn green with
envy. Bess, to be sure, tried feebly to bear in
mind her rules for dieting, but the temptation was
too great, and for that once anyway her good
resolutions went by the board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could die happy now,&rdquo; she murmured, between
bites of a lemon tart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will die anyway if you eat much more,&rdquo;
said her sister severely. &ldquo;Bess Robinson, I&rsquo;m
ashamed of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take twenty rolls to-morrow instead
of ten, to make up for this,&rdquo; laughed Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s a new day,&rdquo; replied Bess
mutinously. &ldquo;Sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a hopeless case, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; sighed
Belle. &ldquo;But come along now, girls, and gather
up these things. We want to get to the house of
Cora&rsquo;s aunt before it gets dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold a stranger cometh,&rdquo; remarked Cora,
as a horse and buggy came in sight, with a young
man holding the reins.</p>
<p>The vehicle approached rapidly, and the eyes
of the driver lighted up as he caught sight of the
three girls. Instead of driving by, he reined up
at the roadside and jumping from the buggy
made his way toward the little party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>He was of medium height, flashily dressed, and
had a weak, dissipated-looking face. The girls
had risen to their feet and drawn a little closer
together as he approached.</p>
<p>He took off his hat and bowed, with a smile
that he tried to make ingratiating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see I&rsquo;m in luck,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Just in time
to have a bite of lunch, if there&rsquo;s any left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora, to whom the other girls looked for leadership,
froze him with a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re hungry, you can probably get something
to eat at the next town,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t anything for tramps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man flushed uncomfortably, and his impudent
assurance went down several degrees beneath
her stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of being so stiff?&rdquo; he expostulated.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only trying to be friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we object to,&rdquo; replied Cora.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want your friendship. My brother will
be along shortly, and perhaps he will appreciate
it more than we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man cast a hurried glance up and
down the road. It was evident that, however
strong his craving for feminine society, he had
no desire to meet the brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he muttered, as he made his way
toward the buggy, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t be so quick to take
offence. There are plenty of girls who would be
glad of my company.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>And with this, that was meant to be a Parthian
shot, but that only provoked a nervous desire to
laugh on the part of the girls, he gathered up the
reins and drove off.</p>
<p>They saw him go with immense relief, for there
was no other man in sight, and his impudence had
alarmed as well as offended them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the nerve!&rdquo; ejaculated Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly can freeze when you want to,
Cora,&rdquo; laughed Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lucky it was that you thought of Jack,&rdquo;
said Belle. &ldquo;Did you see the frightened look that
came into his eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sort of man always is a coward,&rdquo; replied
Cora. &ldquo;Perhaps he won&rsquo;t be so free and easy
when he meets girls alone again. But let&rsquo;s get
busy now and hustle these things back into the
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They soon had the thermos bottle and the depleted
lunch basket tucked snugly away. The twins
settled down in the rear seat, Cora threw in the
clutch, and the car started.</p>
<p>They had gone perhaps a mile, when they descried
a car coming at a rapid rate from the opposite
direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man seems to be trying to break the
speed limit,&rdquo; remarked Cora, as she drove her
own car close to the right-hand side of the road
so as to give plenty of room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like Jehu, the son of Nimshi, he driveth furiously,&rdquo;
observed Belle.</p>
<p>Just then the gate of a near-by farmhouse was
pushed open, and a little child about three years
old toddled out into the road, right in the path
of the onrushing car.</p>
<p>A shriek went up from the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls,&rdquo; screamed Bess, rising from her
seat, &ldquo;that child will be killed!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">QUICK THINKING</span></h2>
<p>For one tense moment it seemed as though
nothing could avert a terrible tragedy.</p>
<p>A woman burst out of the house and ran
screaming toward her child. But it was clearly
impossible for her to reach the little one in time
to save it.</p>
<p>The child, startled by the screams, stood helplessly
right in the path of the Juggernaut that
seemed doomed to crush it.</p>
<p>The driver of the car had seen the danger, and
he instantly threw out the clutch and put on the
brakes. But he was too near to stop in time.</p>
<p>There was only one thing to do, and, like a
gallant man, he did it. He whirled the wheel
around, and the car, its speed diminished but still
considerable, dashed into a tree by the side of the
road. The driver, an elderly man, was thrown
out and lay stunned and bleeding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>The mother rushed to the little one and gathered
it up into her arms with sobs and exclamations.</p>
<p>The girls, who had been unable to move and
had sat paralyzed with horror, breathed a huge
sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God, the baby&rsquo;s saved!&rdquo; cried Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; exclaimed Cora, &ldquo;but the man may be
killed! Let&rsquo;s see what we can do to help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls jumped from the car and rushed
over to the injured man.</p>
<p>While the girls are giving first aid to the man,
and the mother is crying and crooning over her
child, it may be well for the sake of those who
have not followed our Motor Girls in their previous
adventures to state a little more fully just
who they were and what they had been doing up
to the time this story opens.</p>
<p>Cora Kimball and her brother Jack&mdash;the same
Jack who had been brought in so handily in their
encounter with the impudent young man&mdash;were
the children of a wealthy widow living in Chelton,
a New England village located not very far from
the New York line. They were both healthy,
normal, wideawake young people, and took vast
delight in motoring. Either in a motor car or a
motor boat they were equally happy and equally
at home; and Cora was quite as expert in managing
them as her brother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Cora&rsquo;s special chums were Belle and Bess Robinson,
twin daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Perry Robinson,
the former a well-to-do railroad man, living
in the same town as the Kimballs. Belle, as we
have seen, was tall and slender&mdash;&ldquo;<i>svelte</i>&rdquo; was the
way she liked to put it. And Bess&mdash;well, Bess was
&ldquo;plump,&rdquo; but a very pretty and charming girl
nevertheless. Of the three girls, Cora was the
natural leader, and the trio were almost inseparable.</p>
<p>Jack Kimball, Cora&rsquo;s brother, was a manly,
likable chap and devotedly attached to his sister,
although at times he liked to &ldquo;lord it&rdquo; over her
with truly masculine complacency. He was a student
at Exmouth College, and his most intimate
friend was Walter Pennington, who spent most
of his vacations and whatever other spare time he
had at the Kimball home. Perhaps Jack&rsquo;s charming
sister was the special magnet that drew Walter
there so often&mdash;&mdash; But there, it isn&rsquo;t fair to
delve too curiously into matters of that kind.</p>
<p>Paul Hastings, who had a position in an automobile
concern, was a close friend of Jack and
Walter, and the girls too liked him very much.</p>
<p>The love of motoring that all six, boys and
girls alike, shared in common had led to many
trips to various parts of the country, in the course
of which they had met with many surprising and
sometimes thrilling adventures. Both Cora and
the Robinson twins had cars of their own, but as
Cora seemed to take the lead in everything, most
of the tours were taken in her car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Their trips took them at one time or another
to almost every section of the interior and the
coast. At Lookout Beach, through New England,
on Cedar Lake, at Crystal Bay, on the coast,
even as far as the West Indies, all that happened
to them on these expeditions, and it was much, is
told in the previous volumes of the series.</p>
<p>In the volume immediately preceding this one,
called &ldquo;The Motor Girls at Camp Surprise,&rdquo; a
number of very strange happenings are recorded.
To begin with, Cora&rsquo;s car was stolen and she was
almost inconsolable, for though her mother would
have bought her one to replace it, she had an
affectionate attachment for the old one that had
so many happy memories connected with it. They
found no real track of the thieves until, when they
were spending the early part of the summer at
Camp Surprise, they came across a gang of ticket
counterfeiters, who had set up their plant in an
underground passage leading from the very house
where the girls were staying.</p>
<p>And now, as the reader has seen, the girls were
on their way to spend the late summer in the
heart of the Adirondacks. And right at the outset
they had been witnesses of what was so nearly a
tragedy that for the moment their hearts had
stood still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>All alert, now that their terror for the child&rsquo;s
safety was dispelled, the girls hurried over to the
driver, who still lay stretched out in the road. As
they approached he opened his eyes and looked
about him in a dazed way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child,&rdquo; he murmured, as he brushed his
hand over his forehead. &ldquo;Is it safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; replied Cora cheerily, immensely
relieved to find that the driver was not
dead, as she had feared. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t try to talk
now until you feel a little stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knelt down and took his head upon her
knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run to the house, girls, and get some water,&rdquo;
she commanded, taking charge of things, as she
always did in a crisis.</p>
<p>The farmer&rsquo;s wife, who had now got back some
of her self-control, led the way into the house, and
in a moment the girls were back with plenty of
cool water and some linen. Cora washed a cut in
the man&rsquo;s head, deftly tied a bandage around it,
and put some water to his lips, which he drank
eagerly.</p>
<p>The cut was not a serious one, and the farmer,
who had joined the group, announced after a brief
examination that no bones seemed to be broken.
He was urgent that the man should be taken into
the house and a doctor sent for, but the injured
man, who was getting stronger by the minute and
seemed to have a very determined will of his own,
vetoed this emphatically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with me except for
the shock and a few bruises,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be as well as ever as soon as this dizziness passes
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He proved himself a true prophet, for at the
end of ten minutes he was on his feet and looking
ruefully at his car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty much of a wreck, I imagine,&rdquo; he remarked
with a twisted smile, as he walked around
it and took stock of the damage.</p>
<p>The girls joined in the inspection, and as they
knew as much about automobiles as the man himself,
they satisfied themselves that he had not exaggerated
much in describing it as a &ldquo;wreck.&rdquo; The
wheels and part of the body were intact, but the
machinery was badly knocked out of gear. It
was clear that it would not be able to go under its
own power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a garage a few miles further on,&rdquo; the
stranger remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to leave word there
and have them come back to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need of doing that,&rdquo; volunteered Cora.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going in that direction, and we&rsquo;ll be glad
to tow you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
afraid I&rsquo;ve taxed your kindness too far already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be any trouble at all,&rdquo; returned Cora
cordially. &ldquo;You can sit in the front seat with me,
and as my car is a powerful one we&rsquo;ll be able to
tow yours easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He demurred a little longer, but finally accepted
the offer with hearty thanks. The farmer brought
out a rope, and with the aid of a couple of farm
hands got the wrecked machine out in the road.
Then the two cars were connected and the girls
started off, with a parting wave of the hand and a
smile directed especially to the little toddler, who
was held tightly in the mother&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That child won&rsquo;t be allowed to go out of the
gate alone again in a hurry, I guess,&rdquo; laughed
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the child&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; remarked the
stranger. &ldquo;I was going altogether too fast. If
I&rsquo;d been moving at a moderate rate I could have
stopped in plenty of time. Fact is, I was thinking
of something else&mdash;none too pleasant thoughts
they were either&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t realize just how
fast I was going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very lucky to get off as well as you
did, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Cora hesitated inquiringly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Morley,&rdquo; supplemented the stranger. &ldquo;Bless
my heart, here I am accepting all this service from
you young ladies and forgetting to introduce myself.
Samuel Morley is my name, and I live in
the town of Saxton, about twenty miles from here.
Yes, as you were saying, I was very lucky to get
off as well as I did&mdash;a good deal luckier than I
deserved. Though perhaps it would have been
just as well if I had been killed after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought out the last sentence so savagely
that the girls were startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind what I say,&rdquo; he said apologetically,
as he noted the look on their faces.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a crabbed old stick anyway. If I hadn&rsquo;t
been that, I wouldn&rsquo;t have so many painful memories
now. Sometimes they come crowding in upon
me until it seems as though I couldn&rsquo;t stand them.
But I wouldn&rsquo;t want to say anything that would
shadow the faces of young girls. There was a
young girl once&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught himself up sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here I am doing all the talking,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sign I&rsquo;m getting old. Now suppose you
girls turn the tables. Tell me all about yourselves
and where you are going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation became general then, and
from that time on he carefully refrained from
saying anything bearing on himself, although the
girls, who scented a romance or a tragedy somewhere,
would gladly have forborne their own
talk in order to hear more of his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the garage over there,&rdquo; he said, as
they drew near the outskirts of a town, pointing
to a low building on the right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Cora drove her car close in and the keeper
of the garage came out and unfastened the rope
that bound the two machines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thank you young ladies enough,&rdquo; Mr.
Morley said gratefully, as he shook hands with
them. &ldquo;I only hope the time will come when I
can repay the favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you feeling all right now?&rdquo; asked Cora,
as she got ready to throw in the clutch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing worse than a headache. You&rsquo;re a
first-class doctor,&rdquo; he replied with a twinkle in his
eye.</p>
<p>Cora laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell any one,&rdquo; she admonished. &ldquo;It
might get me into trouble. You know, I haven&rsquo;t
a license to practise in this state.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">THE MISSING PURSE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What queer things that man said about himself,&rdquo;
remarked Belle, as she settled back in her
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wild to have him go on,&rdquo; replied her
sister. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s got a romance or a mystery
of some kind in his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see how suddenly he checked himself
when he started to talk about that girl?&rdquo; asked
Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was some girl whom he intended to
marry,&rdquo; said Bess, who had a strong vein of sentiment
in her composition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll never get a chance to know,&rdquo; observed
Belle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve probably seen Mr. Samuel
Morley for the first and last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; rejoined Cora. &ldquo;I
have a sort of feeling that we&rsquo;ll run across him
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the seventh daughter of a seventh
daughter,&rdquo; mocked Belle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sybilla, the reader of the mystic sphere, the
gazer into the crystal globe!&rdquo; gibed Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no prophetess,&rdquo; disclaimed Cora. &ldquo;I just
have a feeling that way. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll have the
laugh on you scoffers yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re willing to wait,&rdquo; returned Belle. &ldquo;Just
now it&rsquo;s the present more than the future that
I&rsquo;m worrying about. That Good Samaritan act
of ours has taken up a good deal of time. And
you know that we planned to stop in that department
store when we get to Roxbury and buy some
of the things we came away without in our hurry
this morning. I&rsquo;ve simply got to have that chiffon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I need a new box of powder,&rdquo; put in
Bess. &ldquo;My old one is nearly empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such victims of the vanity of this world,&rdquo;
sighed Cora. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry, girls. I&rsquo;ll throw
in a little extra speed and you&rsquo;ll hear the car
fairly purr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too fast,&rdquo; cautioned Belle. &ldquo;After what
we saw to-day in the way of fast driving, I&rsquo;m willing
to go a little slower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; promised Cora; &ldquo;but all the
same we can afford to go a good deal faster than
we are moving now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw in more speed, and the gallant car
responded at once with scarcely an added vibration.
In a short time Roxbury was in sight, and
turning into one of the main streets, they drew up
before the doors of the leading store of the town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>They went at once to the veiling department,
where Belle purchased her chiffon. That and the
powder that Bess secured in the drug department
completed all the buying that they had intended
to do. But they were true daughters of Eve, and
so many things met their eyes that they were sure
they simply could not do without, that before they
knew it they had bought quite extensively.</p>
<p>They were standing at one of the counters,
waiting for their change, which seemed an unconscionable
time in coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even Job would have lost patience if there
had been department stores in his day,&rdquo; remarked
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there <i>were</i> department stores then,&rdquo; replied
Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must have been,&rdquo; said Cora. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you remember where Job says: &lsquo;All the days of
my life will I wait till my change come&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls laughed, but the laugh quickly faded
when Cora gave a startled exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls, I&rsquo;ve lost my purse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; cried Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asked Bess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had it in my hand just a minute ago,&rdquo; replied
Cora in much agitation. &ldquo;I took that ten dollar
bill out of it that they&rsquo;re making change for now.
I must have laid it down for a minute, and now
it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were a number of bolts of cloth on the
counter near which the girls were standing, and
they made a hurried search among them without
result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I had nearly a hundred dollars in it,&rdquo;
mourned Cora. &ldquo;Will you please help me look
for my purse?&rdquo; she asked of the man behind the
counter, who had been standing with his back
toward them, busily packing pieces of cloth on
the shelves.</p>
<p>He turned toward them, rather reluctantly the
girls thought, and they were startled to find themselves
looking into the eyes of the young man
who had annoyed them while they were lunching
at the roadside.</p>
<p>A flush suffused his face as the girls looked at
him coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you, ladies?&rdquo; he asked, in
an obsequious tone that was in strong contrast
with the impudent one he had used a few hours
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my purse about here somewhere,&rdquo;
said Cora, &ldquo;and as it had a considerable sum of
money in it I am very anxious to have it found.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>He was profuse in his expressions of regret, and
began with apparent eagerness to turn over all the
goods on the counter, while the girls watched anxiously.
But there was no sign of the purse to be
seen.</p>
<p>Just then the manager of the store came along,
an alert, keen-eyed man, and seeing the little commotion
about the counter, asked courteously if he
could be of any assistance.</p>
<p>He listened carefully to what Cora had to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s singular,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem
from what you say to have been anybody standing
close by within the last few minutes. Are you
quite sure that you had the purse when you came
to this counter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive,&rdquo; replied Cora. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t moved
from here since I took the bill out of the purse to
pay for the goods I bought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you made a careful search, Higby?&rdquo;
asked the manager, fixing his sharp eyes upon the
clerk as though he would read him through and
through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Higby; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll go through
the goods again to make sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tossed the bolts of cloth about vigorously,
and after a moment gave an exclamation of triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Is this your purse,
miss?&rdquo; he asked, holding the article out to Cora.</p>
<p>The latter pounced upon it with a little squeal
of delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Thank
you ever so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would better look over the money to make
sure it is all there,&rdquo; suggested the manager.</p>
<p>Cora ran hastily over the roll of bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she announced in a tone of
relief.</p>
<p>The manager expressed his gratification at its
recovery, coupled with an expression of regret at
the annoyance she had suffered, and the missing
change having come by this time, the girls hurriedly
gathered their purchases together and left
the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lucky girl!&rdquo; exclaimed Belle, as Cora
started the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luckier than I deserve,&rdquo; laughed Cora happily.
&ldquo;It was awfully careless of me to let the
purse out of my hand for a second. It would
have served me right if I had lost it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you really lost it?&rdquo; asked Belle
significantly.</p>
<p>The girls looked at each other, and it was evident
that the same thought was shared by all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it seems mean to say it,&rdquo; remarked
Cora slowly, &ldquo;but since you ask me, I must say
that the whole thing looks queer. There was the
way he kept his back to us when we were looking
for it on our own account. But I don&rsquo;t lay so
much weight on that, because he might have recognized
us and felt a little sheepish after the way we
took him down this afternoon. But why couldn&rsquo;t
he have found it before the manager came along,
and why did he find it so promptly when the
manager was standing there watching him? Of
course, it might have been mixed up in the folds
of the cloth the first time, and dropped out when
he went over the goods again the second time. I
suppose anyway we ought to give him the benefit
of the doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t get the benefit of the doubt from
me,&rdquo; said Bess in so emphatic a manner that the
others, accustomed to her easy-going ways, looked
at her in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hard-hearted thing!&rdquo; exclaimed her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, my children, and you shall hear,&rdquo; began
Bess in her best manner. &ldquo;I kept my eye on
that young gentleman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gorgon stare,&rdquo; murmured her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he was turning those bolts of cloth the
second time,&rdquo; went on Bess, disdaining to dignify
the interruption by noticing it, &ldquo;and while he was
fumbling them with one hand, I saw him bring up
the purse from beneath the counter with the other
hand and slip it under the cloth. Then, before
I could say anything, he called out that he had
found it. I could have shaken you when you
thanked him so sweetly, Cora Kimball.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>The girls looked at each other aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever?&rdquo; gasped Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be exposed!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he ought,&rdquo; agreed Bess placidly.
&ldquo;But after all, the proof wouldn&rsquo;t be strong
enough. It would be simply my word against his,
and he&rsquo;d swear black and blue that I was mistaken.
We&rsquo;d only get mixed up in an ugly mess,
and nothing would come of it after all. I fancy
that that young man will get to the end of his
rope soon enough without our having anything to
do with it. Thank your lucky stars, Cora, that
you&rsquo;ve got your money back, and let it go at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think of Bess playing sleuth and tracking
crime to its lair!&rdquo; cried Belle. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think she
had it in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m some little bright-eyes, if you ask
me,&rdquo; remarked Bess complacently, as she reached
out for the last of the lemon drops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to work this up into amateur theatricals
when the boys join us,&rdquo; laughed Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Belle, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll stage a one-act
play and call it: &lsquo;The Greed of Gold; or, Bess
Robinson, the Girl Detective.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE STERNER SEX</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Talking of the boys&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth
speaketh,&rdquo; drawled her sister.</p>
<p>Bess flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think of them just as much as I do, Belle
Robinson, and perhaps more!&rdquo; she countered.
&ldquo;But what I was going to say when I was so
rudely interrupted was to wonder when they were
ever going to catch up with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack said they&rsquo;d surely overtake us before
night,&rdquo; replied Cora. &ldquo;Walter and he were all
ready, but Paul had had some things to wind up
for his firm before he started in on his vacation.
He had telegraphed, though, that he would be in
Chelton before noon, and Jack said he&rsquo;d show us
just how fast that car of his could travel. He&rsquo;s
awfully proud of that car, but between us, girls, I
don&rsquo;t think he has anything on this car of mine in
the matter of speed,&rdquo; and she patted the wheel
affectionately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope they don&rsquo;t get arrested for speeding,&rdquo;
said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or run over any babies,&rdquo; put in Bess, with a
lively recollection of the thrilling episode of the
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s no danger of that,&rdquo; said Cora.
&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s keen on speed, but he&rsquo;s a careful driver
for all that. I tell you what we&rsquo;ll do, girls. You
keep a sharp lookout in the rear, for they may
come into sight at any minute now, and the minute
you see them coming you let me know. Then I&rsquo;ll
let out a little and we&rsquo;ll try to tease them by keeping
just far enough ahead of them to drive them
crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be dandy!&rdquo; said Belle eagerly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
do them good to take some of the conceit out of
them. I suppose they think we&rsquo;ve been pining to
have them with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Bess mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared Belle, but in a tone
that somehow failed to carry conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like their car now!&rdquo; cried Bess
excitedly, as she caught a glimpse of an automobile
that had just swung around a curve in the
road about half a mile in the rear.</p>
<p>Belle craned her neck in the same direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it is,&rdquo; she confirmed. &ldquo;I can make out
three people in it, but they&rsquo;re too far away to see
their faces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let them get a little nearer so we can
make sure,&rdquo; said Cora, settling herself in her seat
and taking a tighter grasp on the wheel, &ldquo;and
then we&rsquo;ll let them take our dust and see how they
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle knelt upon the seat to get a better view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Anne, Sister Anne, do you see a man?&rdquo;
chanted Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of them,&rdquo; replied Belle, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;re
coming like all possessed. I&rsquo;m almost sure it&rsquo;s
Jack that&rsquo;s driving. There, one of them has taken
out a handkerchief and is waving it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s them,&rdquo; pronounced Belle a moment later,
forgetting her grammar in her excitement, and
scrambling back into her seat again. &ldquo;Now, Cora,
it&rsquo;s up to you to show them what the Motor Girls
can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that your hats are on tight, girls,&rdquo; laughed
Cora. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to stir up some little breeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had a long stretch of road in front of
them at the time, with no house or vehicle in
sight. The conditions could not have been better
for a race, and Cora increased her speed gradually
until the car was going like the wind.</p>
<p>The car behind had taken up the challenge at
once and was also coming along at a tremendous
rate. But Belle, venturing sundry peeks behind,
announced gleefully that it was not gaining an
inch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t enough,&rdquo; Cora flung back. &ldquo;We
want to make them actually drop farther behind.
When we&rsquo;ve once done that I&rsquo;ll be satisfied. Then
we&rsquo;ll slow up and let them catch up to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two minutes later, Belle clapped her hands in
delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done it! We&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a quarter of a mile farther back than
they were when we started in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how we&rsquo;ll rub it into them!&rdquo; gurgled Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, enough is as good as a feast,&rdquo; laughed
Cora, in great satisfaction. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll give the
lords of creation a chance to explain how they
came to let mere girls run away from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take some explanation,&rdquo; remarked
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re great little explainers, though,&rdquo; said
Bess. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d rather die than admit we had
the faster car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora gradually slackened speed until the car,
while still running swiftly, had reached a more reasonable
rate. Belle&rsquo;s glances behind told her that
their pursuers were overtaking them by leaps and
bounds.</p>
<p>A moment later there was a wild chorus of
shouts, and Jack&rsquo;s car drew up alongside. His
two friends, Walter Pennington and Paul Hastings,
were with him, both tall, athletic young fellows,
with frank, pleasant faces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>The girls looked up with well simulated surprise,
and pleasure that was not at all simulated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s the boys!&rdquo; they cried in chorus.</p>
<p>Both cars had by this time come to a full stop,
and the masculine contingent, deserting theirs,
came round to the girls&rsquo; car to greet them and to
shake hands. Jack went further and gave his sister
a hearty kiss, a proceeding which brought a
look of envy to the faces of his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the world have you slowpokes
been?&rdquo; asked Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of a compliment, keeping away
from us so long,&rdquo; pouted Bess in a way to show a
most bewitching dimple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;ve been glad enough to be rid of
us for a while,&rdquo; chimed in Cora.</p>
<p>Looks full of reproach and denial greeted this
onslaught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty good!&rdquo; remarked Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich!&rdquo; assented Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as if we hadn&rsquo;t been breaking speed laws
all day long in order to overtake you,&rdquo; mourned
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of living when you&rsquo;re so misunderstood?&rdquo;
groaned Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all the ice-creams and sodas we&rsquo;ve blown
in on these girls, too!&rdquo; wailed Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find a hole somewhere and crawl away
and die,&rdquo; suggested Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that the shoe&rsquo;s on the other
foot anyway,&rdquo; said Walter, becoming accuser in
his turn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you who didn&rsquo;t want us. Who
was it just now that was trying to run away from
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away from you?&rdquo; repeated Cora innocently.
&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know perfectly well, you little minx,&rdquo; said
her brother with mock sternness. &ldquo;There we were,
waving handkerchiefs at you and hustling the old
machine along to beat the band. I know you saw
us, for one of you was looking back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did see some one waving a handkerchief,&rdquo;
admitted Belle. &ldquo;But it looked as though some
ill-bred person was trying to flirt with us, and
of course we didn&rsquo;t pay the least attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bess primly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d die before we&rsquo;d
flirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;d wanted to flirt we had a perfectly good
chance to-day while we were eating lunch,&rdquo; said
Cora. &ldquo;He had a perfectly lovely necktie, too,
a good deal brighter than any of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack threw up his hands with a gesture of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use, fellows!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
pin them down to anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what did you have to wave your handkerchief
for anyway to make us stop?&rdquo; asked Cora
demurely. &ldquo;All you had to do was to put on more
speed and catch up to us. That car of yours is so
fast, you know. At least that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve always
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys looked at each other a little disconcertedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-well,&rdquo; stammered Jack, &ldquo;the oil&mdash;the sparking
wasn&rsquo;t working just right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the truth, Jack,&rdquo; spoke up Walter, with
a fine assumption of candor. &ldquo;The real reason,
girls, was that we were afraid of bumping into
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we didn&rsquo;t want to spill you all over the
road,&rdquo; finished Paul.</p>
<p>A groan went up from the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ananias!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ananiases, you mean,&rdquo; corrected her sister.
&ldquo;One&rsquo;s just as bad as the others. They all hang
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re like Ben Franklin when he signed the
Declaration of Independence,&rdquo; laughed Paul.
&ldquo;He said they&rsquo;d all have to hang together or
they&rsquo;d hang separately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit that you have a good car, sis,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if that isn&rsquo;t enough to take us back into
favor, we&rsquo;ll do anything else you say,&rdquo; said Walter,
wringing his hands in pretended agitation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put on sackcloth and ashes, jump through
a hoop, roll over and play dead,&rdquo; chimed in Paul.
&ldquo;No one has anything on us when it comes to
humility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It almost affects me to tears,&rdquo; said Belle, pretending
to reach for her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say cruel and unusual punishments are
prohibited by the Constitution,&rdquo; laughed Cora,
&ldquo;so we won&rsquo;t deprive you of the refining influence
of our society. Heaven knows you need it badly
enough. We&rsquo;ll let you trail along with us if you&rsquo;ll
promise to be very, very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; promised Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing yet that needs to be explained,
fellows,&rdquo; remarked Walter, as they
climbed into their automobile. &ldquo;What about that
fellow with the iridescent necktie? I feel the
demon of jealousy gnawing at my vitals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, girls, &rsquo;fess up,&rdquo; admonished Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was just charming,&rdquo; said Cora promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly lovely,&rdquo; agreed Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such soulful eyes!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess languishingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I should ever have lived to hear this!&rdquo;
groaned Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess our cake is dough,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eftsoon and gadzooks!&rdquo; cried Jack, striking
an attitude, &ldquo;lead me to him, and sooth it shall go
hard with me if my trusty sword drink not the
caitiff&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you don&rsquo;t need to go as far as that,&rdquo;
laughed Cora. &ldquo;Leave him alone and the police
will take care of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A-ha, a criminal!&rdquo; cried Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That only makes him the more romantic,&rdquo; declared
Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t help our case one bit,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard of how women will deck a
murderer&rsquo;s cell with flowers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d have the nerve to be a murderer,&rdquo;
remarked Belle. &ldquo;His specialty is stealing
purses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while the boys listened intently and threw
in occasional indignant exclamations, the girls told
of the young man&rsquo;s attempt to scrape acquaintance,
and of how later he had almost succeeded
in getting possession of Cora&rsquo;s purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cur!&rdquo; growled Jack. &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d happened
along when he was trying to get fresh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You helped me out just the same, even if you
weren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; replied Cora. &ldquo;You ought to have
seen how he made tracks for his buggy when I said
my brother would be along shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Jack, throwing out his chest,
&ldquo;how the terror of my name has preceded me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s comforting anyway,&rdquo; chimed in Walter.
&ldquo;It proves that we men are good for something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that the girls ought to have us with them
all the time as trusty knights and vassals,&rdquo; added
Paul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too ready to jump to conclusions,&rdquo; rebuked
Cora. &ldquo;But now we&rsquo;d better be hurrying
along. It&rsquo;s getting towards dark, and we&rsquo;ll have
all we can do to get to Aunt Margaret&rsquo;s in time
for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack. &ldquo;Where have I
heard that word before? Lead me to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can keep up with us in that
car?&rdquo; asked Cora wickedly. &ldquo;If not, I&rsquo;ll give you
a tow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to her rubbing it in!&rdquo; moaned Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t enough to beat us,&rdquo; complained
Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that fellow was right,&rdquo; remarked
Jack, &ldquo;who said that Indians and women were
alike. They both scalp the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">A GROUP OF VAGABONDS</span></h2>
<p>The two cars rolled along smartly, for the
various happenings of the day had put the Motor
Girls behind the schedule they had hoped to make.
But despite their best efforts, dusk was settling
down and the stars beginning to peep out when
they drove up to the Kimball&rsquo;s Aunt Margaret&rsquo;s
door.</p>
<p>She greeted them affectionately, and after they
had washed off the dust of travel they were seated
at the sumptuous meal she had had prepared in
anticipation of their coming. After dinner was
over, a number of young people in the neighborhood
who had been invited to meet the tourists
dropped in, and there was music and dancing. But
Aunt Margaret&rsquo;s watchfulness over her charges
prevented this from being prolonged to an unseasonable
hour, and by eleven o&rsquo;clock all the tired
travelers were sleeping the dreamless sleep of vigorous,
healthy youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>They needed a good sleep, for the longest lap
of their journey still lay before them. And it
was at an early hour the next morning that, after
a hearty breakfast and cordial thanks and good-byes
to their gracious hostess, they climbed into
their cars and drove off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off at last for the Adirondacks!&rdquo; cried Jack
gaily, as he drew in great draughts of the fresh
morning air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for Camp Kill Kare!&rdquo; added Paul.</p>
<p>The girls had started off a little ahead of them,
but the boys soon drew alongside and Jack signaled
for Cora to stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have speech with thee, fair maiden,&rdquo;
he remarked, as his sister obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora in pretended vexation.
&ldquo;Here are those rude boys interrupting us
just when we were having the loveliest talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you weren&rsquo;t talking about anything
very important,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bess, dimpling, &ldquo;we were talking
about you boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And saying what a lovely thing it was to be
all by ourselves for a little while,&rdquo; put in Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; exhorted Walter solemnly, &ldquo;remember
that if there was an Ananias there was also a
Sapphira.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not so keen on having a stag party ourselves,&rdquo;
explained Jack, &ldquo;and we thought it would
be a dandy thing if one of you girls would come
into our car and one of us fellows go to yours.
That would make life one grand sweet song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all comes from what Cora said yesterday
about the refining influence of feminine society,&rdquo;
said Walter. &ldquo;I feel the need of that. In fact,
I have a consuming desire to become refined. And
I can&rsquo;t be, as long as I associate with these two
low-brows. So you&rsquo;d better let me ride in your
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave us in our native coarseness?&rdquo;
queried Paul. &ldquo;Not on your life, old man! I
need refinement just as much as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, brethren,&rdquo; interposed Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do
this thing on the level. My claims to coarseness
are just as strong as either of yours, but do you
see me engaging in unseemly brawls? Nay and
again nay. We&rsquo;ll pull straws for it and may the
coarsest man win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that we want any of you,&rdquo; said
Cora. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t take incurable cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too harsh, Cora,&rdquo; said Belle. &ldquo;You
know they say there&rsquo;s a spark of good in the very
lowest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;While the lamp holds out to burn</p>
<p class="t0">The vilest sinner may return,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>hummed Bess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>There were no straws at hand, but some matches
served as well, and Walter proved to be the lucky
one. Belle agreed to go to Jack&rsquo;s car, and Walter
took her place alongside of Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Walter, as he availed himself
of his good fortune. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saved. I&rsquo;m doomed
to refinement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doomed?&rdquo; laughed Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I say doomed?&rdquo; Walter answered. &ldquo;How
careless of me! Of course I meant destined to
refinement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be eating lotus blossoms and
water lilies before long,&rdquo; called out Jack, as the
cars started up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch me when lunch time comes,&rdquo; grinned
Walter. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t mind what you fellows say.
I&rsquo;ve got two refining influences while you have
only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need all you can get,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s parting
shot.</p>
<p>With merry chaff and banter, the time flew by
as though on wings. They had lunch at a quaint
little inn by the roadside, and Walter proved
that the charms of feminine society had not yet
begun to affect his appetite. But then, as he explained,
the cure would be all the more effective
if it were gradual, and he had plenty of time yet
to climb to higher planes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>In the early afternoon they were turning a bend
in the road, when Cora gave a sudden exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she cried, pointing to a little glade at
the right of the road. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a camp of some
kind. I do believe it&rsquo;s gypsies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guessed it right the first time,&rdquo; declared
Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; agreed Bess. &ldquo;Oh, Cora,
don&rsquo;t you think we might stop a few minutes?
I&rsquo;d dearly love to have a look at them, if you
think we can spare the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so very keen about it myself,&rdquo; said
Cora dubiously, for as those familiar with her
previous adventures will remember, her experiences
with these picturesque vagabonds had not
been devoid of unpleasantness and danger. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;ll see what Jack says about it, and if he thinks
we have time, I won&rsquo;t mind stopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hailed Jack, and, after consulting his watch,
the latter agreed that they could easily spare a
half-hour or so for a visit to the gypsy camp.</p>
<p>They drew their cars to the side of the road
and picked their way through the woods to the
little dell where the gypsy encampment lay.</p>
<p>It was a typical camp of those strange nomads
in whose blood runs the &ldquo;call of the wild,&rdquo; and
who in their mode of life are almost as far removed
from other human beings as though they
lived upon another planet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>There were perhaps a dozen vans, from which
came strange smells of cooking, amid which onion
and garlic predominated. Unkempt children in
tattered clothing played with dogs that seemed to
be legion, while wrinkled and slatternly women sat
on the steps of the vans or made their way through
the grounds, whining their requests to visitors to
cross their palms with silver and learn in return
all that pertained to their present and future.
Swarthy men, some of them with huge ear-rings
and with sashes and turbans that reminded one of
the pirates of tradition, lay sprawled out on the
grass watching the throng with eyes that were
sometimes indifferent and again sullen and smoldering.</p>
<p>There were just two elements that redeemed
the camp from its general aspect of squalor and
forlornness. One was the fine horses that were
scattered here and there, for the gypsy has the
keenest eye for a good animal of any trader on
earth. The other was the presence of several
gypsy girls of a wild barbaric type of beauty,
whose flashing eyes and gaudy trinkets contrasted
with the prevailing ugliness of their surroundings.</p>
<p>There were a large number of visitors present,
due to the proximity of a large town a mile
or so away, through which the automobiles had
passed just before reaching the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the place to have your future told,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky they can&rsquo;t tell our past,&rdquo; remarked Walter.
&ldquo;What a give-away that would be for some
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you haven&rsquo;t any deep dark secret that
would &lsquo;chill the young blood, harrow up our souls&rsquo;
if it were told,&rdquo; laughed Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter just wants to make himself interesting,&rdquo;
gibed Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever I may have been, I&rsquo;m all right
now that you girls have undertaken to refine me,&rdquo;
replied Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m realizing more and more what a tremendous
contract it is,&rdquo; Cora came back at him. &ldquo;But
look at that girl over there? Isn&rsquo;t she a beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t hard to look at, for a fact,&rdquo; said Jack
judicially, as his eyes fell on the gypsy girl his
sister had indicated. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll get her to tell
my fortune. I want to know whether I&rsquo;m born to
be hanged or drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe to say that you&rsquo;re booked for a long
life anyway,&rdquo; remarked Paul. &ldquo;Only the good
die young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl had seen that the party were regarding
her with interest, and she came over to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ladies want to have your fortunes
told?&rdquo; she asked with a winning smile that showed
two rows of beautiful white teeth.</p>
<p>The girls hesitated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, girls, and show the sporting spirit,&rdquo;
urged Jack. &ldquo;You can get the promise of a perfectly
good husband for fifty cents. And that&rsquo;s
cheap in these days of high prices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than some of them are worth,&rdquo;
laughed Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that isn&rsquo;t a shot at us,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
be a bargain at a dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have been thinking of that Higby
fellow over at Roxbury,&rdquo; said Bess. &ldquo;Why,
what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she asked, as the gypsy girl
started violently and turned deadly pale.</p>
<p>Cora sprang to the girl&rsquo;s side and put her arm
around her to steady her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">A PERPLEXING PROBLEM</span></h2>
<p>The gypsy girl regained her self-control in a
moment and gently put Cora&rsquo;s helping arm aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I just had an attack
of dizziness. The heat of the sun, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident that this last remark was only a
pretext, for a pleasant breeze was blowing and
they were standing under a great tree that shaded
them completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it wasn&rsquo;t anything I said that startled
you,&rdquo; said Bess curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it have been?&rdquo; put in Belle incredulously.
&ldquo;You only referred jokingly to that
Higby fellow who nearly got away with Cora&rsquo;s
purse when we were shopping yesterday. I&rsquo;m
sure there&rsquo;s nothing in that to startle anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora had been watching the girl intently, and
at this second mention of the young man&rsquo;s name
she saw a swift spasm&mdash;was it of pain or fright
or a combination of both?&mdash;sweep over the girl&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind,&rdquo; said Cora briskly, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;re all right now. Perhaps you&rsquo;d
better have a drink of water. Jack, suppose you
go to the car and get one of the drinking cups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack started promptly to obey, but the girl objected
so strongly that he stopped and stood irresolute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;please not. Only leetle
deezy, but all right now,&rdquo; she continued, dropping
into the slipshod gypsy manner of speaking. &ldquo;Let
me tell pretty ladies&rsquo; fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just then one of the gypsy men, who had
been watching the group sharply, stepped up to
the girl and spoke to her roughly in a jargon that
the girls could not understand. It was evidently
a command, for the gypsy girl turned instantly
and went away, disappearing into one of the vans,
while the man, after a scowl that included all the
party, sauntered away and dropped on the grass
beside some of his comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of that?&rdquo; demanded
Belle in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just when she had a husband picked out for
each of you, too,&rdquo; chaffed Paul. &ldquo;But cheer up,
girls. We&rsquo;re here yet. Count on us to the last
breath. You can&rsquo;t lose us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck,&rdquo; retorted Bess. &ldquo;But what on
earth made that man act that way?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t like gypsies to let good money get
away from them,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;and they must have
seen from our open countenances that we were
easy marks and ready to cough up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said Walter severely, &ldquo;please pass up
that line of chatter&mdash;I mean, please refrain from
such vulgar slang. In my unregenerate days I
could have stood for it&mdash;I mean, endured it&mdash;but
since I have become refined it hits me on the raw&mdash;I
mean, it affects me painfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop your nonsense, you boys,&rdquo; chided
Cora. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m trying to think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cora&rsquo;s trying to think!&rdquo; exclaimed her irrepressible
brother. &ldquo;Heaven be praised that I
have lived to see this day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora gave him a scornful glance, and Jack
sagged down at the knees, pretending to wilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just how did that girl strike you?&rdquo; asked Cora
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A peach,&rdquo; replied Jack promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pippin&mdash;I mean, she was very good looking,&rdquo;
added Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking the girls,&rdquo; said Cora witheringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t seem to me like a gypsy at all,&rdquo;
answered Bess. &ldquo;And yet I suppose of course
she must be, since she&rsquo;s here with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice the way she spoke when she was
off her guard for a moment?&rdquo; asked Belle. &ldquo;She
said that she had &lsquo;an attack of dizziness.&rsquo; Later
on, she was a &lsquo;leetle deezy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Her eyes were blue,&rdquo; remarked Cora musingly,
&ldquo;and that is something unusual in a gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But her complexion was as dark as any of the
others,&rdquo; objected Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be accounted for by the tan from
the open-air life,&rdquo; replied Cora. &ldquo;And then, too,
it would be easy to color it artificially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know girls ever did such things,&rdquo; interrupted
Jack with a pained expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then too,&rdquo; went on Cora, unheeding,
&ldquo;when her sleeve fell back, I saw that her arm
was white. But what I&rsquo;m trying to get at especially
is whom she looks like. She resembles
some one that I&rsquo;ve seen before, but I can&rsquo;t remember
who it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose made her act so queerly
when I spoke of the stealing of your purse?&rdquo;
asked Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the robbery itself that startled her,&rdquo;
said Cora. &ldquo;It was the name of the man, Higby.
He was mentioned twice, and each time she looked
frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if she knows him,&rdquo; murmured Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said there were lots of girls who would be
glad of his company,&rdquo; laughed Bess. &ldquo;Perhaps
she is one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no liking in that look of hers,&rdquo;
replied Cora emphatically. &ldquo;It was positive
alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If a mere man may break into this discussion,&rdquo;
said Jack humbly, &ldquo;you fair detectives haven&rsquo;t yet
told us why that pirate over there took the girl
away from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; interposed Walter. &ldquo;He was
jealous. It was my fatal gift of beauty that worried
him. The girls all fall for it&mdash;I mean, are
attracted by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; asked Cora exasperatedly, &ldquo;why are
those long legs of Walter&rsquo;s like organ grinders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it up,&rdquo; said Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; explained Cora, &ldquo;they always carry
a monkey about with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter staggered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stung!&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;Penetrated, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t suffer too much, poor boy,&rdquo; said
Cora soothingly. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s any comfort to you to
know it, your two accomplices in crime are just as
bad. Women are the only sensible human beings
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they human?&rdquo; asked Walter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
thought of them as angels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop trying to square yourself,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t knuckle down to them,&rdquo; Jack adjured
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; replied Walter, &ldquo;or they won&rsquo;t let me
ride with them any more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to, anyway; that is, for the
rest of this afternoon,&rdquo; said Cora. &ldquo;I want to
have the girls in the car with me where we can
talk over this thing without being interrupted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut out from Eden,&rdquo; groaned Walter bitterly.
&ldquo;You wash your hands of me. You cast me into
outer darkness. Just when the better part of my
nature was getting uppermost, you put me back
into low company. I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it of
you, girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to the kennel, you hound!&rdquo; exclaimed
Paul, seizing him by the collar. &ldquo;You might have
known that the girls would throw you down. They
always do, sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now that Lucifer as lightning has fallen
from heaven,&rdquo; remarked Jack, &ldquo;what do you say
to hustling along? The afternoon waneth and my
appetite waxeth. Dinner at Camp Kill Kare
sounds awfully good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; assented Cora reluctantly;
&ldquo;but I would like to have another
glimpse of that gypsy girl first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re only visitors
here anyway, and we haven&rsquo;t any right to
intrude on their private affairs when they show us
so clearly they don&rsquo;t want us to. Ten to one it&rsquo;s
only a mare&rsquo;s nest anyway that you&rsquo;re stirring up,
sis, about the girl. Probably she&rsquo;s an honest to
goodness gypsy, just like the rest of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what my common sense tells me,&rdquo;
agreed Cora, &ldquo;but something outside of common
sense tells me that she isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I feel about it too,&rdquo; echoed
Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I too,&rdquo; agreed Belle. &ldquo;She may have been
stolen when she was a child. That happens often
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so often as it used to,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;The
telegraph and the telephone make it too risky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how about it?&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Are you
three Graces coming along, or do we three scapegraces
have to wend our way to Camp Kill Kare
alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is now!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess, as she
caught sight of the gypsy girl looking at them
from the door of the van.</p>
<p>But a wrinkled crone who was sitting on the top
step of the van reached out a skinny arm and
angrily pushed the girl inside and out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve evidently made up their minds that
we&rsquo;re showing too much interest in her, and for
some reason they don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; sighed Cora.
&ldquo;Well, come along, girls. We&rsquo;ll have to go. But
that gypsy girl has a history and a secret, and I&rsquo;d
give a good deal to find out just what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">THE MOUNTAIN CAMP</span></h2>
<p>The Motor Girls, followed by the boys, made
their way briskly back to the cars and climbed in,
Walter resuming his place with the other boys
and Belle going back to Cora and Bess.</p>
<p>For some time previous to running across the
gypsy camp they had been rising higher and higher
into the mountains, and now the road became still
steeper. They had to run more slowly in consequence,
for although both cars were good hill-climbers,
it took a good deal of power to make
any kind of speed. Besides, as they got farther
into the wilderness, the road was rougher and
more neglected. But it was just this wildness
they had come to seek, and their spirits rose with
the difficulties they encountered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You go in advance, Jack,&rdquo; said Cora, as the
road grew narrower until it was difficult for the
two cars to go side by side. &ldquo;Of course, having
the faster car, I suppose we ought to show the
way, but we&rsquo;re nothing if not magnanimous. If
your car balks we&rsquo;ll push you along. Besides, you
have the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about pushing us along,&rdquo; retorted
Jack. &ldquo;Just for that, I ought to shoot ahead out
of sight and leave you to bitter regrets when you
find yourselves lost in the wilderness. But I&rsquo;m too
noble to treat helpless girls that way, so you&rsquo;re
safe for the present. But beware, woman, of
goading me too far! It&rsquo;s a long worm that has
no turning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re as mixed in your road directions as
you are in your proverbs, I&rsquo;m afraid we won&rsquo;t get
to Camp Kill Kare to-night,&rdquo; rejoined Cora. &ldquo;But
go ahead now like a good boy, and think up some
more bright things to spring on us. We want to
be by ourselves so that we can talk without foolish
interruptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want to talk,&rdquo; muttered Jack. &ldquo;What a
novelty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If women talk a good deal, I notice that lots
of men take after their mothers,&rdquo; replied Belle,
as Jack&rsquo;s car darted into the lead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it tantalizing,&rdquo; said Cora to her chums,
resuming their interrupted conversation, &ldquo;that I
can&rsquo;t think just whom that gypsy girl looks like?
Don&rsquo;t you know how it is when you are trying to
recall a word or a line of poetry or something,
and have it just on the tip of your tongue but can&rsquo;t
quite get it? I feel just that way about this resemblance.
I&rsquo;m perfectly sure I&rsquo;ve seen some one
very much like her. Can&rsquo;t you girls help me out?
We&rsquo;re together so much, and we know the same
people. Put on your thinking caps and see if you
can&rsquo;t give me a hint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish I could,&rdquo; replied Belle thoughtfully.
&ldquo;There <i>was</i> something a little familiar
about the girl, though it didn&rsquo;t strike me as
strongly as it did you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a certain look in her eyes that suggested
somebody I&rsquo;ve seen,&rdquo; said Bess, &ldquo;but for
the life of me I can&rsquo;t remember who it was. But
even suppose we did remember? It wouldn&rsquo;t
prove anything. There are lots of people in the
world who look alike and yet who haven&rsquo;t the
slightest relation to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; admitted Cora. &ldquo;But just the same
I have what the boys would call a hunch that in
this case it would give us a clue to the gypsy girl&rsquo;s
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she has any,&rdquo; laughed Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out your crystal sphere, Sybilla, and pluck
the heart from this mystery,&rdquo; smiled Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girls can laugh if you want to,&rdquo; rejoined
Cora, &ldquo;but all the same I&rsquo;ll think about this and
perhaps dream about it until I recall the face I&rsquo;m
groping for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if we&rsquo;d have something
more practical to think of before long,&rdquo; remarked
Belle, pointing to the sky. &ldquo;Do you see those
clouds coming up there? I&rsquo;ve been watching them
for the last five minutes and they&rsquo;re getting bigger
and blacker all the time. I&rsquo;d hate to be caught in
a thunderstorm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And get into Camp Kill Kare all wet and bedraggled,&rdquo;
added Bess. &ldquo;Oh, Cora, let&rsquo;s hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t getting wet that bothers me so much,&rdquo;
replied Cora. &ldquo;We could put up the top and keep
dry enough. But a heavy storm would turn the
road into a quagmire, and goodness knows it&rsquo;s
bad enough as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys ahead had seen the signs, and Jack
shouted back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her all the juice she can stand, sis! If
the storm only holds off for fifteen minutes we&rsquo;ll
make the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His own car shot ahead, and Cora threw in the
speed and kept close behind. They could hear
now faint rumblings of thunder, all the more noticeable
because of the sudden hush that had fallen
over the forest, as birds and animals and insects
sensed the coming storm.</p>
<p>Darker and darker it grew and faster and faster
the cars sped along, as their drivers called on the
last ounce of speed they had in them. Despite
their fluttering of anxiety, the girls had a keen
sense of exhilaration in this race with the elements.
Their veils whipped about their faces and
their glowing eyes and reddened cheeks showed
their inward excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>A jagged flash of lightning shot across the sky,
followed by a deafening peal of thunder. It was
evident that the bolt had struck not far off, for a
moment later they heard the crash of a falling
tree at a little distance to the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hurry! hurry!&rdquo; urged Bess and Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m creeping?&rdquo; Cora called back.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk to the car and encourage it as I might
a horse. You&rsquo;ll notice that the boys aren&rsquo;t leaving
us behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the cars were nearly
touching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep up your pluck, girls!&rdquo; Jack called back.
&ldquo;If this map is all right, we&rsquo;ll make the camp in
five minutes more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we didn&rsquo;t have an old tub in front of us,
we&rsquo;d make it in four,&rdquo; sang out Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the rain will only hold off,&rdquo; murmured Belle.</p>
<p>But the prospect grew ever more threatening.
The peals of thunder were redoubled and the
lightning played so vividly across the sky that
Bess covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose the car should be struck!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were, we&rsquo;d probably never know it,&rdquo; was
all the comfort her sister could give.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Just then there was an appalling roar, and a
great tree, split from top to bottom, swayed for a
moment and then fell with a deafening crash right
across the road, about a hundred feet in front of
the leading car.</p>
<p>There were shrieks from the girls, and a jumble
of shouts came from the boys, as Jack brought
his machine to a halt, and Cora, who had not lost
her presence of mind, did the same.</p>
<p>All jumped out and ran forward. A glance
told them that there was no getting past the tree.
It blocked the road completely. Nor was it possible
to get around the fallen monarch with the
cars, for there was dense undergrowth on both
sides of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No help for it, girls,&rdquo; announced Jack, after
a hurried examination of the conditions. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to run for it. I caught a glimpse of the
bungalow a minute ago, and it&rsquo;s not far from
here. We&rsquo;ll have to leave the cars here and come
back and cut a path for them after the storm&rsquo;s
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose they should be stolen?&rdquo; objected
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty little chance of that in this neck of
the woods,&rdquo; replied Paul. &ldquo;You notice we haven&rsquo;t
met any one for the last two hours. We&rsquo;ll put
up the tops so that the inside won&rsquo;t get wet. And
there&rsquo;ll be some one at the bungalow that we can
send out to guard them and keep you from worrying
about them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got to make tracks for the house.
Come ahead, girls!&rdquo; cried Jack, as soon as the
tops had been put up.</p>
<p>Each of the boys took charge of one of the
girls, and they skirted the tree, pushing their way
through the underbrush till they reached the road
on the other side.</p>
<p>The outdoor life of the Motor Girls had made
them fleet and strong, and although of course with
their clinging skirts they could not keep up with
the boys, the latter accommodated their pace to
theirs, and they came in sight of the bungalow in
a few minutes.</p>
<p>But the rain was coming, too, and it was a pretty
race. They could see it being driven before the
wind in great gusts, and they felt the pattering
of the advance drops. And just as they gained
the shelter of the bungalow porch, the rain came
down in torrents.</p>
<p>Their coming had been seen from the house,
and Aunt Betty King came running out to meet
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You darlings!&rdquo; she cried, as she tried to gather
all the girls at once into her arms, and kissed
them in turn. &ldquo;How glad I am to see you! I&rsquo;ve
been watching for you for the last two hours and
was beginning to worry for fear you wouldn&rsquo;t get
here before dark. And how lucky you were to
get here ahead of the storm. But how on earth
did you come?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We ran here all the way from Chelton,&rdquo; said
Jack with a sober face. &ldquo;How is that for Marathon
work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay any attention to that fibber,&rdquo; laughed
Cora. &ldquo;You know what Jack is. Our cars are
standing a little way down the road. The lightning
struck a tree and it fell so that it blocked
the path. So we had to make the rest of the way
on foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor dears!&rdquo; exclaimed Aunt Betty with
ready sympathy. &ldquo;But come right in now and get
rested. You must be awfully tired after your
long journey, and you&rsquo;re all out of breath from
running so hard. And you boys, too. Your rooms
are all ready for you and supper will be ready in
a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led the way inside, followed by the flushed
and panting travelers, glad that the end of their
journey found them safely housed at Camp Kill
Kare.</p>
<p>The bungalow was a strongly built and capacious
one. It had only two stories, but was very
wide and deep. It stood on a high point in the
Adirondack Mountains, with a view that stretched
for many miles in all directions. There was a
large cleared space about the building, but one
had only to go a few rods away to find himself in
a genuine wilderness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>The bungalow belonged to a relative of Mrs.
Kimball. Usually the owner occupied it himself
during the summer months; but this year he was
on a trip to India, hunting for big game, and he
had placed the camp at Mrs. Kimball&rsquo;s disposal,
with a cordial invitation to occupy it and make
use of all the facilities it afforded for enjoyment.</p>
<p>As Cora&rsquo;s mother could not accompany the
young folks, the question of a suitable chaperon
had given her some concern. But this had been
solved by securing the consent of Aunt Betty to
undertake that responsibility.</p>
<p>Mrs. King was not really Cora&rsquo;s aunt, being a
second cousin of Mrs. Kimball. But everybody
called her by the comfortable and affectionate title
of Aunt Betty, and she was a great favorite in
the Kimball home, which she frequently visited.
She was a widow without children, and she welcomed
the opportunity of mothering this lively
brood of young people.</p>
<p>The main floor of the bungalow was divided
into two parts by the long hall that ran from
front to back. On the right was a large living
room and library combined. Off from this was a
music room, and the girls gave little cries of delight
as they saw a handsome baby grand piano
through the porti&egrave;res.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>On the left of the hall was the dining room,
which appealed more strongly to the boys than
the music room, and back of this was the kitchen,
from which savory odors were wafted to their
olfactory organs.</p>
<p>Up the broad stairs Aunt Betty led the way,
and pointed out to the various members of the
party the rooms they were to occupy. Those of
the girls were on the south side of the house,
while the boys&rsquo; quarters faced the north. Trunks
had been sent on before and were in the rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What perfectly darling rooms!&rdquo; cried Cora,
as the delighted girls let their eyes roam over
the two connecting rooms that had been assigned
to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; shouted Jack from across
the hall, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t forget that there&rsquo;s a perfectly
darling little dining room downstairs, and I&rsquo;m
honing to make its acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; flung back Belle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be
ready to go down as soon as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Listen to my low,
mirthless laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">FUN IN THE OPEN</span></h2>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s sardonic laugh seemed to be justified, for
the boys had been below stairs for several minutes
before the girls came trooping down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more proof that I&rsquo;m never mistaken,&rdquo;
Jack remarked, as he shook his head sadly at the
laughing bevy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys haven&rsquo;t so much to do as we girls
have,&rdquo; said Belle, making a little face at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t, eh?&rdquo; replied Walter. &ldquo;I lost all
my hair-pins in that mad sprint for the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the rain took my hair out of curl,&rdquo; added
Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I had the greatest hunt before I found
my box of powder!&rdquo; said Jack in a high falsetto.</p>
<p>Just then Mrs. King came in from the kitchen,
where she had been supervising the preparations
for dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come right along now and take your places
at the table,&rdquo; she beamed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Table is my middle name!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack,
as he led the way, followed by the others.</p>
<p>It was a sumptuous meal that Aunt Betty had
prepared, and with their appetites sharpened by
their long ride, the travelers did it full justice.
And the warmth and good cheer of the cozy dining
room were emphasized by contrast with the
rain that beat upon the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A regular flood,&rdquo; commented Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noah would have felt at home in that,&rdquo; said
Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; interposed Paul. &ldquo;Noah
was supposed to take two specimens of every kind
of animal when he went into the Ark. But there
was one species he overlooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats,&rdquo; replied Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; inquired Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Paul answered, &ldquo;he had been sailing
forty days before he saw ary rat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment of stunned silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ararat!&rdquo; Cora at length exclaimed. &ldquo;Paul,
how could you inflict that on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be shot at sunrise,&rdquo; said Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you see, Aunt Betty, what we&rsquo;ve had to
stand on our journey up here,&rdquo; moaned Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say you seem to have thrived on it,&rdquo;
smiled Aunt Betty, looking at the rosy cheeks and
sparkling eyes of the girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good for Aunt Betty!&rdquo; cried Walter. &ldquo;She
appreciates us! You girls will too, when you&rsquo;ve
seen a little more of men and realize how we
stand out from the common herd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that woman,&rdquo; asked Bess, turning
to Cora, &ldquo;who said that the more she saw of men
the more fond she grew of dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, misguided female,&rdquo; said Paul pityingly.
&ldquo;I suppose she was an inmate of a lunatic asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More to be pitied than censured,&rdquo; added Jack.</p>
<p>By this time they had reached dessert, and when
they had finished, Aunt Betty proposed an adjournment
to the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly dry and snug out here,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and I think the rain will be over soon anyway.
When it rains so hard up here it doesn&rsquo;t last very
long. But you girls had better get some wraps,
for even though it is August, the nights are rather
cool, especially after a storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an abundance of big, comfortable
chairs on the porch, and they grouped them into
a semi-circle and sat laughing and talking, on the
best of terms with themselves and the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was rather a narrow escape we had this
afternoon,&rdquo; remarked Bess. &ldquo;If we had been a
hundred feet further on the road than we were,
that tree would have come down plump on top of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A miss is as good as a mile,&rdquo; returned Jack
lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, I suppose those poor old cars of
ours are getting a thorough soaking,&rdquo; observed
Cora. &ldquo;What are you going to do about them,
boys? It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that we ought to let
them stay there all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s up to us fellows to take a turn
down there and look them over,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;The fact is that I&rsquo;ve had such a good dinner that
I feel too lazy to move. But far be it from me
to resist the plain call of duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with us girls going along
with you?&rdquo; asked Bess.</p>
<p>Aunt Betty looked aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, in all this mud and rain?&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that we Motor Girls are used to
being out in all kinds of weather,&rdquo; laughed Cora.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll promise to wrap up well if you let us
go. It&rsquo;s lucky that our trunks were sent on up
here ahead of us, so that we have our rubbers
and raincoats all ready to get into. Besides, it&rsquo;s
practically stopped raining now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Betty was very easily won over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send Joel, the stableman, along with a lantern,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;He knows the woods like a
book by night or day. Then, too, he&rsquo;s as strong
as an ox, and he can help to get the cars out of
the fix.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll take a couple of axes along,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;I have an idea some tall chopping will
have to be done before we get the cars where
they belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls went up to get their raincoats and
overshoes, while the boys got their hats and
hunted up Joel.</p>
<p>He was a tall, gaunt backwoodsman, who in
his earlier days had been a guide in the Adirondack
region. But periodic attacks of rheumatism
had made it difficult for him to continue his calling,
and he had become the man of all work at
Kill Kare Camp. He knew the forest thoroughly
and had an intimate acquaintance with the habits
of every creature that had fur, fin or feather.</p>
<p>Despite his somewhat advanced years, he was
still a powerful man, and his strength was equaled
by his good-nature and reliability.</p>
<p>The boys liked him at once, and he on his part
was very friendly and cordial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve got a couple o&rsquo; them buzz wagons
stalled there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Never rode in one in
my life, but the pesky things suttinly have it all
over a hoss when it comes to git up and git.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a treat waiting for you, then,
Joel,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;Some day we&rsquo;ll take you
riding, and you&rsquo;ll go so fast you&rsquo;ll have to hold
on to your hair to keep it from being blown off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t prezactly pinin&rsquo; fur no sich speed as
that,&rdquo; said Joel. &ldquo;I sh&rsquo;d think them gals w&rsquo;u&rsquo;d
be skeered to death to ride in one uv them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They drive them as well as ride in them,&rdquo;
returned Jack. &ldquo;My sister can handle one of them
as well as any man can. You ought to have seen
the race she gave me yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; replied Joel, and it was evident
that his respect for the feminine members of
the party had gone up several degrees.</p>
<p>They were soon equipped with a lantern and
three axes. In addition, Joel took along some
sticks of resinous wood to serve as torches, and
they came around to the front porch, where they
found the girls impatiently waiting for them.</p>
<p>All started out in high spirits, Joel leading the
way. The road was muddy, but they found fairly
good footing on the turf that bordered it. The
rain had now entirely ceased.</p>
<p>It was not long before they reached the fallen
tree, and they found the cars standing where they
had left them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye needn&rsquo;t hev bin much skeered,&rdquo; grinned
Joel. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t many folks come along this
way, an&rsquo; them that do is giner&rsquo;lly honest. It&rsquo;s only
when the gypsies come round thet we hev to keep
a tight grip on things, specially hosses. Them
gypsies suttinly is light-fingered, an&rsquo; they kin beat
a weasel in gittin&rsquo; into places where they ain&rsquo;t got
no business to be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We saw a camp of them to-day,&rdquo; said Cora,
in whom the word &ldquo;gypsy&rdquo; just now woke an
instant response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is thet so?&rdquo; asked Joel in surprise. &ldquo;Then
they&rsquo;re probably headed up this way. I heven&rsquo;t
seen &rsquo;em around these diggin&rsquo;s fur sev&rsquo;ral years
now, and I wuz hopin&rsquo; I&rsquo;d never see their ugly
faces ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see Joel go to the mat with that
pirate that took the girl away from us to-day,&rdquo;
grinned Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be some scrap,&rdquo; agreed Walter, as
he took in the brawn and bulk of the backwoodsman.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d bet on Joel unless the other fellow
used a knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to see more clearly what they were
doing, the torches were lighted and placed where
they would do the most good. Then Joel surveyed
the scene of action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s jist one thing to do,&rdquo; he finally announced,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; thet is to cut through this tree an&rsquo;
git it off uv the road. It might be a leetle bit
easier to git the cars around through the brush,
but the tree can&rsquo;t be let to stay there blockin&rsquo; up
the road, an&rsquo; I might ez well git it out of the way
fust ez last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took off his corduroy jacket and rolled up
the sleeves of his shirt, showing the mighty biceps
beneath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to do it all alone,&rdquo; protested
Jack. &ldquo;Let us help. There are two axes
besides yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Joel a little dubiously, &ldquo;you boys
ain&rsquo;t used to this kind uv work, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m afraid
it&rsquo;ll use ye up too much. It ain&rsquo;t only the strength,
but there&rsquo;s a knack about usin&rsquo; a woodsman&rsquo;s ax
thet it takes time to git on to. Still, ye kin try
it fur a while if ye want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Paul took off their coats, while the
girls, who were perched like so many birds in
Jack&rsquo;s car, clapped their hands in mock applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold the gallant foresters,&rdquo; sang out Belle.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Woodman, spare that tree,</p>
<p class="t0">Touch not a single bough!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>quoted Bess.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To-day it threatened me,</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ve no use for it now,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>improvised Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the trilling of the merry songsters,&rdquo;
said Jack, with impressive sarcasm. &ldquo;They toil
not, neither do they spin. They mock and fleer
at us sons of honest toil. They&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get to work, Jack,&rdquo; Cora interrupted him
heartlessly. &ldquo;I love to see you work. It&rsquo;s so unusual.
Joel will have the trunk cut through before
you boys get started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus adjured, Jack and Paul started in with a
right good will, each attacking the trunk at a
distance of about ten feet on either side of Joel.</p>
<p>Both boys were strong and sturdy, and they
worked the more vigorously because they were
under the appraising eyes of the girls. But their
work was nothing compared with Joel&rsquo;s. Nowhere
could there have been found a more striking
illustration of the advantages of the professional
over the amateur.</p>
<p>Joel&rsquo;s work was the very poetry of motion.
Back and forth his flashing ax swung tirelessly,
biting with resistless force into the very heart of
the tree, and in a surprisingly short time he had
cut the trunk entirely through.</p>
<p>Walter took his turn with the other boys and
did valiant execution. But all were soon winded
with their unusual exertions, and were forced to
rest, while the perspiration poured down their
faces in streams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has got it all over a Turkish bath,&rdquo; muttered
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet I&rsquo;ve lost five pounds in as many minutes,&rdquo;
growled Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an idea for you, Bess,&rdquo; said her sister
mischievously. &ldquo;Talk about reducing. You&rsquo;d be
a sylph in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a corpse, you mean,&rdquo; responded Bess.
&ldquo;No, thank you. I&rsquo;ll take my reducing in homeopathic
doses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joel at this point insisted on finishing the job.
He had not turned a hair in his previous exertions,
and he seemed as fresh as ever when the
work was completely done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now how are we going to get the logs off the
road?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with making the car do its
share of the work?&rdquo; asked Cora. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fasten
a rope to each one of the logs and with you men
guiding them we can drag them to one side of the
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plan met with instant approval and in a
very few minutes the road was clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, sis,&rdquo; said Jack approvingly. &ldquo;Now
we&rsquo;ll bundle these tools into the cars and go to
Camp Kill Kare in style.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">THE &ldquo;WATER SPRITE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The next morning dawned clear and beautiful.
The storm of the day before had washed the dust
from plants and trees, and seemed to have washed
the very air itself, for it was as clear as crystal
and had a tonic quality that set the blood to
dancing.</p>
<p>Cora had awakened early and stolen to her
window, where she sat entranced by the beauty of
the view. But she was not allowed to enjoy it
long, for there came a thundering knock on the
door that made her jump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, you sleepyheads!&rdquo; sounded
Jack&rsquo;s voice from outside. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too fine a morning
to waste it in sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now be up and doing!&rdquo; chanted Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day is one to stir the sluggard blood!&rdquo;
added Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys just trot along,&rdquo; sang out Cora defiantly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to take our time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You always do,&rdquo; retorted Jack. &ldquo;If time were
money you girls would be millionaires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them rave,&rdquo; remarked Belle, as she opened
her sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have another forty winks,&rdquo; said
Bess, as she turned over on her pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; declared Cora, as the boys
went clattering down the stairs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfectly
gorgeous day, girls, and it&rsquo;s simply a crime to
waste it in bed. The view from these windows is
enough to make you gasp. Besides, we don&rsquo;t want
to keep breakfast waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bess still protested, but yielded to the laughing
threat of being dragged from bed if she did not
get up of her own accord, and the girls hurried
with their dressing.</p>
<p>They found the boys already at the table, making
huge inroads on the food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see we&rsquo;re waiting for you,&rdquo; remarked
Jack, as he passed his plate for another helping
of bacon and eggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Cora, &ldquo;I see you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a gallant lot!&rdquo; reproached Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d get up till noon,&rdquo; defended
Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Paul, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve heard of something
that makes us want to hustle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Bess with lively interest,
as the girls took their seats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Betty tells us that there is an old motor
boat down on the lake,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t
been used much for the last two or three years,
and it&rsquo;s probably a good deal out of repair. We
thought we might be able to tinker it up and take
you girls out for a sail on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, we&rsquo;re always thinking of how we can
give you girls a good time,&rdquo; observed Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you weren&rsquo;t expecting to have a good
time yourselves,&rdquo; mocked Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that there was a lake so close
at hand,&rdquo; said Belle delightedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I told you about it?&rdquo; said Cora.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had so much to talk about that I must
have omitted that from my description. But there
is a beautiful mountain lake not more than five
minutes&rsquo; walk from here. I didn&rsquo;t know that there
was a motor boat anywhere round, though. I&rsquo;m
wild to have a look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spend too long a time at the table then,&rdquo;
admonished Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty good, coming from you,&rdquo; countered
Belle. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry. You boys live to
eat, while we eat to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of you seems to be wasting away,&rdquo; retorted
Jack. &ldquo;But hurry along now and all will
be forgiven. We fellows have got to go out and
see if Joel has the tools we&rsquo;ll need for tinkering
up the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>They excused themselves and went out, while
the girls, who were all agog with the new pleasure
promised them, hurried through their meal
and were ready for the trip when the boys returned.</p>
<p>A few minutes of brisk walking brought them
to the borders of a lake whose blue waters shimmered
in the morning sun. An exclamation of
delight broke from them as they gazed upon its
beauty.</p>
<p>The lake stretched for about four miles in one
direction and was perhaps a mile and a half in
width. Near the center of it they could see a
small island that appeared to be heavily wooded.</p>
<p>Not far from where they were standing was a
small boathouse with a pier projecting into the
lake. Near the end of the little dock a motor
boat was moored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the boat!&rdquo; cried Jack, and they all
made a rush for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Water Sprite</i>,&rdquo; read Cora from the partly
effaced letters on the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has good enough lines,&rdquo; said Walter, as he
ran his eyes over the boat, &ldquo;but it seems as though
it had been pretty well neglected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner never used it much,&rdquo; explained
Jack. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t care much for the water, and
when he was here spent most of his time in hunting
on land.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks pretty much like junk to me,&rdquo; admitted
Paul, as he took in the dilapidated appearance of
the boat.</p>
<p>The others could not help agreeing that Paul&rsquo;s
criticism seemed justified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look as though she&rsquo;d be worth taking
much trouble for, does she?&rdquo; remarked Jack
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t say that she&rsquo;d just come
from a motor-boat show,&rdquo; observed Paul; &ldquo;but
just the same she may be a well made boat and
capable of speed too if she&rsquo;s put in decent condition.
Of course she looks like a total loss now,
but it&rsquo;s wonderful what a little work will do.
Let&rsquo;s take a look at the engine anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They boarded the little craft and removed a
tarpaulin that had been spread over the engine.
The boys then proceeded to give the latter a
thorough inspection, first, however, bailing out
the water that had collected in the bottom of
the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, as his eyes lit
on the manufacturer&rsquo;s name plate, &ldquo;this is a good
little motor, no doubt of that. You know that
any engine these people put out is bound to be
first class, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; agreed Paul, &ldquo;but the
best engine ever built can be ruined by carelessness
and neglect.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Walter, &ldquo;but there may not be
so much the matter with this chugger after all.
First thing to do is to turn the old engine over and
see how it sounds.&rdquo; He had already put in some
oil and gasoline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine idea,&rdquo; panted Jack after applying all
his strength to the flywheel without result. &ldquo;The
trouble is that it won&rsquo;t turn at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Walter, taking it from his hand,
&ldquo;let me try. Only you mustn&rsquo;t mind if I pull the
whole engine out of the boat. I&rsquo;m mighty apt
to if I really let myself go, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to Samson talking!&rdquo; gibed Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Look out for flying
splinters, Paul. Sampson is going to tear things
wide open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mighty strong,&rdquo; mocked Paul. &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t ask you to prove it. He admits it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were no flying splinters, however, for in
spite of all Walter&rsquo;s exertions, the engine remained
immovable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that proves that she&rsquo;s a good solid boat
to stand the strain,&rdquo; grinned Walter, at last giving
over the attempt.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The muscles of his brawny arms</p>
<p class="t0">Are strong as iron bands,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>jeered Cora.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess there&rsquo;s nothing to do,&rdquo; continued Walter,
&ldquo;but take the engine down and see what&rsquo;s
wrong. It feels as though the parts had grown
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be if you couldn&rsquo;t move it,&rdquo; said Jack
scathingly. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s get busy, fellows. I suppose
the first thing to do is to get the cylinders
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They fell to with a will, and soon had the
smaller fittings dismounted. The motor was of
the two-cylinder, two-cycle type, and according to
the makers&rsquo; plate was rated at six horse power.
The exterior was in fairly good condition, only a
few patches of rust showing here and there where
the paint had been chipped off, leaving the metal
exposed.</p>
<p>With some difficulty, the boys got the cylinders
off. As they removed the front one, Jack gave
a long whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet there&rsquo;s the cause of the trouble,&rdquo; he
said, pointing to the front cylinder.</p>
<p>The others examined it and Paul remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;s a case of broken piston ring, eh,
Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; was the response.</p>
<p>And indeed this would have been plain even to
the most inexperienced eye. One of the grooves
cut in the piston to receive a compression ring
was packed with broken bits of metal and metallic
dust, many of the fragments having actually
been reduced to powder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bad job,&rdquo; remarked Walter, shaking
his head. &ldquo;I wonder if the cylinder itself is damaged
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy to find out,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were relieved to find that the cylinder was
very little scored, considering the condition of the
piston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks to me as if a new set of piston rings
would be necessary,&rdquo; judged Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;But it would
probably take a week to get them from the manufacturers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora gave a little exclamation of dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wait all that time before we can have a
ride in the <i>Water Sprite</i>?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you can wave a magic wand and make
the pistons come running,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to rummage through these lockers,&rdquo;
declared Cora, jumping up and going into the
little cabin. &ldquo;Perhaps there are some spare parts
on hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later she gave an exclamation of
triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are!&rdquo; she cried, holding up a pair
of the much desired rings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Takes a woman to do things,&rdquo; said Belle in
a superior way.</p>
<p>The boys looked a little sheepish, but at the
same time delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a fairy all right,&rdquo; conceded Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the real thing, sis,&rdquo; beamed Jack, as
he held out his hand for the rings. &ldquo;And now
for the dirty work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They adjusted the rings and overhauled the rest
of the engine, which proved to be in fairly good
condition. There were no radical defects, and by
dint of hard work they soon had the entire machinery
in what seemed to be good working order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; panted Jack, as he straightened up,
&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re some little machinists, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be able to get a union card,&rdquo; said
Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toil has no terror for us!&rdquo; declared Paul,
striking an attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those boys just hate themselves, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
laughed Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve worked pretty hard&mdash;for them,&rdquo; admitted
Cora. &ldquo;And as a special reward, boys,&rdquo;
she added generously, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll let you take us for
our first ride in the <i>Water Sprite</i> this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">SPRINGING A LEAK</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You do us too much honor,&rdquo; said Paul, making
a low bow in his best Chesterfieldian manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that perfectly well,&rdquo; replied Cora;
&ldquo;but I happen to feel in a condescending mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, girls!&rdquo; exclaimed Belle, consulting
her watch, &ldquo;do you know that it&rsquo;s nearly
twelve o&rsquo;clock? We&rsquo;ve been working here all the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;ve</i> been working!&rdquo; repeated Jack with
marked emphasis. &ldquo;I can see that you&rsquo;re all out
of breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Those also serve who only stand and wait.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of job I&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; said Walter,
wiping the perspiration from his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance,&rdquo; opined Paul. &ldquo;The girls have
got in ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I notice you wouldn&rsquo;t have been very far
ahead if Cora hadn&rsquo;t found those rings,&rdquo; retorted
Bess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You boys are well enough where only muscle
is concerned,&rdquo; said Belle patronizingly, &ldquo;but when
it comes to a matter of brains you&rsquo;re not in the
same class with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried back to the house, where they
found a substantial meal ready for them. Then
the girls put on their boating togs, and they
started out to try the sailing qualities of the rejuvenated
<i>Water Sprite</i>.</p>
<p>The boys cast off the moorings, and Cora, who
could run a boat as well as any one, took her
place at the wheel. Jack stayed near the engine,
where he could keep an eye on its workings, and
the rest disposed themselves wherever they could
be most comfortable.</p>
<p>There was hardly any wind blowing and the
water was scarcely stirred by a ripple. It was an
ideal day for boating and they were prepared to
enjoy it to the full.</p>
<p>The boat darted away from the dock as though
it shared the jubilant spirits of the party, and
Jack observed with great satisfaction that the engine
was chugging away without missing a beat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s working like a dream,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look at the way she minds the wheel,&rdquo;
said Cora. &ldquo;She yields to the slightest touch.
It&rsquo;s no trouble at all to handle her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where she differs from most members
of the fair sex,&rdquo; hazarded Walter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And see how fast she&rsquo;s going,&rdquo; said Bess, ignoring
the gibe. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re half a mile from shore
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hug the shore and go all the way around
the lake. We may be able to pick out some splendid
spots to go picnicking in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And on the way back let&rsquo;s land on the island,&rdquo;
suggested Bess. &ldquo;I wonder if anybody lives
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joel told me that there was a man who had a
cabin over there and comes up here almost every
summer,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;He lives all alone, and
spends his time in collecting plants and flowers.
Joel can&rsquo;t understand that. Thinks he&rsquo;s a bug. I
suppose he&rsquo;s a botanist or something of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he ought to have plenty of chances on
that island,&rdquo; remarked Cora as her eye took in
the luxuriant verdure of the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he wouldn&rsquo;t care to have us break in
upon him,&rdquo; observed Belle. &ldquo;He may be of the
crank or hermit type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a woman-hater,&rdquo; laughed Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is, you&rsquo;ll cure him,&rdquo; declared Walter gallantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he won&rsquo;t object,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;Anyway,
he doesn&rsquo;t own the island. He just camps
out on it, and we have as much right there as he
has.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>They had quickly reached the further end of
the lake, and kept up a running fire of delighted
exclamations at the beauties that nature had flung
about this favored place with reckless prodigality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a painter could only put it on canvas,&rdquo; sighed
Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never could!&rdquo; exclaimed Belle. &ldquo;The best
he could do would be a poor imitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Bess drew up her foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;my foot is soaking wet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked at the bottom of the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little water that&rsquo;s seeped in,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the bailer from the cabin
locker and throw it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter bestirred himself and got the bailer. But
after he had used it for a minute, a puzzled look
came into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming in faster than I can get it out,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Belle uttered a little cry, and Bess became a
trifle pale.</p>
<p>The other boys crowded around Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is coming in pretty fast for a fact,&rdquo; muttered
Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all have to get at it,&rdquo; said Jack soberly.</p>
<p>There was only one bailer in the boat, and there
was nothing else in the shape of a can or pail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your sweaters,&rdquo; said Jack to the boys.
&ldquo;Soak up the water and wring them out over the
side of the boat. Lively now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>A moment more and the boys were working
like beavers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been the straining of the engine,&rdquo;
explained Jack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s started a board in the old
tub. Work like the mischief, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bess and Belle were huddled together in alarm,
but they said nothing to betray the panic that was
growing upon them.</p>
<p>Cora&rsquo;s lips were pressed a little more tightly
together and her cheeks were a trifle pale. But
her eyes were glowing like stars, and were full of
courage and determination.</p>
<p>She gave the wheel a turn and headed straight
for the island, which was the nearest land.</p>
<p>The water continued to gain, and as the boat
settled a trifle in consequence of the added weight,
its progress was necessarily slower.</p>
<p>The boys were working frantically. Bess and
Belle would have gladly helped, but in the narrow
limits of the boat they would only have been
in the way.</p>
<p>The open space in the bottom of the boat was
yawning now. Jack doubled up his sweater and
thrust it into the opening, while the others continued
to bail.</p>
<p>Still the water gained, and the boat was perceptibly
settling. But they were near the island now,
and Cora turned the bow toward a low, shelving
part.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>A moment more and, with a sensation of infinite
relief, they felt the bow slide into the mud
of the bottom. Jack leaped to the engine and
stopped its chugging. Then all took a long breath
and looked at each other.</p>
<p>The faces of the boys were white and in the
eyes of the girls there was more than a suspicion
of anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land ho!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, giving his sister a
hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Castaways!&rdquo; cried Paul dramatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not on a desert island, thank heaven!&rdquo;
said Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are we to get on shore without getting
wet?&rdquo; queried Belle, a lesser anxiety seizing her,
now that the greater one was dispelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you ask that,&rdquo; said Walter reproachfully,
&ldquo;when there are three husky sailors here who ask
nothing better than to carry you to the shore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a foot deep near the bow,&rdquo; declared
Jack. &ldquo;Over we go, boys,&rdquo; and he set the example,
that was instantly followed by his comrades.</p>
<p>Each took one of the girls and landed her
safely on the shore. With the exception of Bess&rsquo;
wet feet, the girls were almost as fresh and unruffled
as ever, but the boys with their dripping
trousers clinging closely round them presented a
comical picture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, laugh at us!&rdquo; said Walter, as the
girls looked at them with mirth in their eyes.
&ldquo;Here we risk our lives for you and that&rsquo;s all
the reward we get. Suppose a shark had bitten
us when we were wading to the shore with our
cargo of beauty. Suppose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his diatribe was interrupted by the appearance
of a man who stepped from the trees that
came down near to the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>He looked at the party with a whimsical smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Mr. Morley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; echoed Bess and Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very same,&rdquo; smiled the newcomer. &ldquo;And
you are the young ladies that came to my help the
other day when I ran my car into a tree. Who
would have supposed that we would meet again so
soon and under such different circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook hands heartily with the girls, and
then was introduced to the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had something like a shipwreck, I see,&rdquo;
he said, as he looked at the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing very serious,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;Although
it might have been, if we&rsquo;d had much
farther to go to reach shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; returned Mr. Morley. &ldquo;However,
I&rsquo;m very glad it wasn&rsquo;t worse. But come
up to my cabin. It&rsquo;s only a little way from here.
You can build a fire outside and stand about it
until your clothes are dry. I live rather simply
here, but I can offer you some refreshments. After
that, we&rsquo;ll see what we can do toward patching
up your boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>He led the way, chatting with Cora, and the
rest followed. A few minutes&rsquo; walk brought them
to the cabin. It was a small, one-story structure,
with three rooms. One served as a living room,
dining room and kitchen combined, while the
others consisted of a sleeping room and a room
where Mr. Morley kept his specimens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A poor place, but mine own,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted their
host, with a smile. &ldquo;I spend most of my summers
here looking for specimens. The rest of the year
I teach botany in a college. Now I&rsquo;m going to
bring out some cakes and tea and put the young
ladies in charge, and we&rsquo;ll have a regular afternoon
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the girls fluttered about inside, preparing
the refreshments, Mr. Morley and the boys built
a fire a little way from the door, and in a little
while the youths were dry and comfortable again.</p>
<p>It was a gay party that a little later sat around
the table where the girls had spread the refreshments.
Mr. Morley seemed genuinely glad to
have them with him, and the boys and girls were
in the highest spirits. What might have been a
disaster had developed into a lark.</p>
<p>While the girls were clearing up the things later,
their host went down with the boys to the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>He had brought along some boards and oakum,
together with necessary tools. His own rowboat
enabled them to board the <i>Water Sprite</i> without
getting another wetting. Once there, the boys
took off their shoes, rolled their trousers to the
knees and set to work. In less than an hour they
had repaired the damage. Then they bailed out
the water and watched anxiously to see if any more
came in.</p>
<p>But their anxiety was needless. The work had
been well done, and the boat floated high and dry
on the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">CORA MAKES A DISCOVERY</span></h2>
<p>The boys, followed by Mr. Morley, retraced
their steps to the cabin and told the good news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Cora, &ldquo;I suppose we must go.
It was awfully good of you, Mr. Morley, to take
us shipwrecked travelers in and treat us so nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others echoed this sentiment, but Mr. Morley
put in a vehement disclaimer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing compared to what you did for me
the other day,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t tell
you how much good it has done me to have you
young people here. It&rsquo;s a long time since I&rsquo;ve
had youth in my home. But that&rsquo;s my own fault.
I drove it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought himself up with a sharp turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to take a look at my specimens
before you go,&rdquo; he remarked tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d dearly love to,&rdquo; replied Cora.</p>
<p>Mr. Morley led the way into the specimen
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just now I&rsquo;m making a collection of vampires,&rdquo;
he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No accounting for tastes,&rdquo; whispered Walter
to Paul, in a voice too low to be heard by their
host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you keep them in a cage?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>Mr. Morley looked up in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;you spoke of vampires,
and I thought you meant vampire bats. They&rsquo;re
the only kind of vampires I know anything about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was referring to the plant this leaf was taken
from,&rdquo; smiled their host, as he held it up for them
to see.</p>
<p>It was a long, rounded leaf that seemed to be
covered with tiny hairs, on which glistened something
that resembled honey and gave forth a fragrant
odor. On looking more closely they saw
what appeared to be fragments of small insects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We call it the sun-dew,&rdquo; explained Mr. Morley.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s common enough, and you&rsquo;ve seen it in
the fields many a time. But instead of living on
elements drawn from the soil, it feeds on flies and
other insects. They are attracted by the honey
that it spreads out temptingly to bring them within
its reach. But as soon as they light on it, the
leaf tightens around them and crushes them to
death. Then it eats them at leisure. That&rsquo;s why
it&rsquo;s called a &lsquo;vampire.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected Cora, &ldquo;any one would think
from that that the plant had intelligence and knew
just what it was doing, just as an animal does
when it hunts for prey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Morley. &ldquo;Who are we
to say that plants don&rsquo;t have intelligence? What
proof is there in nature that they don&rsquo;t suffer and
enjoy, feel and plan, as men and animals do, only
on a lower plane? We humans are too conceited.
We assume that we possess intelligence almost exclusively.
We grant some to animals, though we
slur even that by calling it only instinct. But we&rsquo;ve
been inclined to deny it altogether to plants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t agree with this at all. And there
are lots more of the newer school of naturalists
who feel just as I do about it. Wherever there is
life there is intelligence. Plants can be cunning
and patient and cruel and deceitful. If they can&rsquo;t
get enough of one kind of food, they hunt for
another. When men and animals do these things
or show these qualities, we admit that it is the
result of thought. What is it, then, that makes
a plant do precisely similar things with similar
ends in view?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there,&rdquo; he interrupted himself with a smile,
&ldquo;one might almost think that I was in my lecture
room, talking to a class! It&rsquo;s a hobby of mine,
and I forget sometimes that others may not be so
interested in it as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we <i>are</i> interested, keenly interested,&rdquo; protested
Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of plants in that way before,&rdquo;
declared Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s opened up an entirely new way of looking
at things,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there many kinds of vampire plants?&rdquo;
asked Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of them,&rdquo; replied Mr. Morley. &ldquo;And
they use all kinds of devices&mdash;hooks, claws, poison,
honey, snares and shocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desperate characters,&rdquo; whispered Walter to
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than gunmen,&rdquo; murmured Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, for instance,&rdquo; continued their host, &ldquo;is
the &lsquo;devil&rsquo;s snare&rsquo; that is found in South America.
It has long, snaky tentacles that sweep the ground
for many yards in every direction, for all the
world like the long suckers of the devil-fish. It
gobbles up anything that comes within its reach,
insects, mice and larger animals. Once it gets its
deadly grip on a victim, it keeps on tightening and
tightening until it chokes the life out of it. It has
been known to grasp and kill a good-sized dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horrid thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess with a little
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The S. P. C. A. ought to get after it,&rdquo; laughed
Walter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are plants, too,&rdquo; continued their mentor,
&ldquo;that show intelligence by the way they adapt
themselves to changed conditions. The bladderwort,
for example, used to live on insects. Perhaps
it got a hint somewhere that it could do better
on water than on land. At any rate, it became a
water plant. It lies just under the surface and
imitates the wide-open mouth of a mother fish.
The little minnows swim into it to avoid their
enemies and as soon as they&rsquo;re well inside, the
mouth closes and the plant regales itself with a
fish dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there are the cannibal plants. There are
hundreds of trees that have the life juices sucked
from them by the parasitic plants that twine
around them until they give up the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as the trusts do to the common people,&rdquo;
observed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cora, drawing a long breath, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always known that nature was cruel, but I&rsquo;ve never
connected that idea with plants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cruel everywhere,&rdquo; assented Mr. Morley,
&ldquo;from man, creation&rsquo;s crown, to plants, creation&rsquo;s
base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked with a new interest and a heightened
respect at the other specimens he showed, and
the time passed so quickly that they were startled,
on glancing out of doors, to see how rapidly dusk
was coming on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I get to mooning along on my pet theories,
I never know when to stop,&rdquo; said Mr. Morley
apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a real treat to listen to you, Mr.
Morley,&rdquo; said Cora with her winning smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truth is not only stranger but more interesting
than fiction,&rdquo; smiled Belle.</p>
<p>They separated with cordial good wishes and a
hearty invitation to Mr. Morley to visit them at
Camp Kill Kare. He stood at the cabin door,
watching them as they hurried down to their boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the end of a perfect day,&rdquo; sang Bess
gaily, as they stepped on board the <i>Water Sprite</i>,
which the boys had brought around to the little
dock at which Mr. Morley&rsquo;s rowboat was tied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly has been a crowded one,&rdquo; said
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Mr. Morley an unusual man?&rdquo; asked
Cora. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more and more convinced that there&rsquo;s
a mystery about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine chap,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t
notice anything especially mysterious about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a man,&rdquo; said Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help belonging to that despised sex,
can I?&rdquo; inquired Jack in an injured tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s your misfortune rather than your
fault,&rdquo; dimpled Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose he meant when he said
&lsquo;I drove it,&rsquo; and then stopped so suddenly?&rdquo; asked
Belle thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably thinking of his car when he drove it
into a tree,&rdquo; remarked Jack flippantly.</p>
<p>If he had not been hardened, he would have
succumbed before the exasperated glare of three
pairs of girlish eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get in out of the wet, Jack,&rdquo; counseled
Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over here and I&rsquo;ll protect you with my
life,&rdquo; adjured Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay any attention to those idiots, girls,&rdquo;
advised Cora. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait until we get by ourselves
and can talk sense without being interrupted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Water Sprite</i>, as though repenting of its
lapses that afternoon, was now on its good behavior,
and she kept &ldquo;dry as a bone&rdquo; on the short
passage from the island.</p>
<p>They found Mrs. King a little worried at their
late coming, and she threw up her hands at the
story of their narrow escape from sinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a lively brood wished on you,
Aunt Betty,&rdquo; laughed Cora, as she threw her arm
affectionately around her aunt&rsquo;s waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see that already,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;My
only comfort is that you girls seem to bear a
charmed life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it &lsquo;charming,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Walter gallantly,
&ldquo;and we boys will agree with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>They had some music after dinner, but as all
were tired from their strenuous day they went to
their rooms early.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; exclaimed Cora, as soon as they were
alone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found out whom that gypsy girl resembles!
It&rsquo;s Mr. Morley!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">AN UGLY CUSTOMER</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morley!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess and Belle in a
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo; demanded Cora. &ldquo;I was struck
by it when we first saw him just after we got off
the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I come to think of it, I believe you&rsquo;re
right,&rdquo; replied Belle slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a way of holding his head like hers,&rdquo;
agreed Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the eyes,&rdquo; went on Cora. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
blue like hers, and there are times when they have
exactly the same expression. Girls, I believe we&rsquo;re
on the edge of a mystery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so loud,&rdquo; cautioned Belle, &ldquo;or the
boys may catch something of what you&rsquo;re saying
and they&rsquo;ll tease us to death about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, after all, what does it all amount to?&rdquo;
asked Bess. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t prove that they have the
slightest connection with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And even if they have, what could we do
about it?&rdquo; asked Belle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the dog running
after the train. What would he do with it
if he caught it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a tangle,&rdquo; admitted Cora. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t
go to Mr. Morley and tell him that we&rsquo;d seen a
gypsy girl who reminded us of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He mightn&rsquo;t take it as a compliment,&rdquo; suggested
Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or he might think we&rsquo;d gone crazy,&rdquo; said
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are probably ten million people in the
world that the gypsy girl looks like in one way or
another,&rdquo; said Bess, with difficulty suppressing a
yawn. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to bed and forget all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Cora, as she slipped between the sheets,
was far from intending to dismiss the subject in
such cavalier fashion.</p>
<p>At breakfast the next morning, Paul proposed
that they should visit an old logging camp that
Joel had told him was located a few miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t in operation now,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to visit it in winter to see it running
full blast. But it will be interesting to see the
bunk-houses and the flumes, and get an idea of
the way the work is carried on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have to do much walking,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;Joel says that the road between here and
there is a pretty good one for the cars. We can
take our lunch along and make an all-day picnic
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls fell into the plan with enthusiasm, and
in a short time the cars were brought to the front
of the house, and they were ready to start.</p>
<p>Joel stood by, looking on with lively curiosity,
as Cora took the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about a little spin for a mile or two?&rdquo;
laughed Cora.</p>
<p>Joel grinned a little sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; urged Cora, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll show you
what fast going is really like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better make your will, Joel,&rdquo; laughed Jack.
&ldquo;That sister of mine is some speed demon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it will put ye out in yer plans,&rdquo; objected
Joel, though it was plain he was tempted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; returned Cora cheerily. &ldquo;We
have all day before us. The rest will stay here,
while you and I go down the road for a mile or
two and back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joel looked at Mrs. King, and as she smiled
her approval, he climbed clumsily into the car and
sat in the back seat. Cora threw in the clutch,
and the car started off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on to your hair, Joel,&rdquo; Jack shouted
after him.</p>
<p>The road was fairly good right there, and Cora
increased the speed until the car was going well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Joel gasped and held on tight to the sides of
the car. He had never traveled on anything
faster than the little narrow-gauge railroad train
that wheezed along at about ten or fifteen miles
an hour. Now he was moving at the rate of forty
or more.</p>
<p>After about two miles had been covered, Cora
eased up and prepared to turn the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Joel?&rdquo; she asked mischievously,
as she straightened out for home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s scrumptious, miss!&rdquo; gasped Joel, &ldquo;but
ain&rsquo;t ye feared ye&rsquo;ll wreck yer car? Doesn&rsquo;t seem&rsquo;s
if anything on four wheels c&rsquo;u&rsquo;d stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; replied Cora, and
again Joel was treated to a burst of speed that set
his heart thumping violently against his ribs.</p>
<p>It was with a sigh of relief that he climbed
down from the car when it had come to a full stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sufferin&rsquo; cats!&rdquo; exclaimed the old backwoodsman,
as he faced his grinning audience, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve faced
b&rsquo;ars an&rsquo; painters an&rsquo; catamounts, but I wuz never
so plumb skeered in all my life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; to think uv a gal havin&rsquo; the spunk to drive
like that!&rdquo; he muttered to himself, as he made
his way back to the barn. &ldquo;She suttinly is some
gal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little rich for Joel&rsquo;s blood, I guess,&rdquo; laughed
Jack, as the gay party started off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll grow to like it, though,&rdquo; prophesied
Cora. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be ready for another one by the
time we get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cars moved along now at a moderate pace,
for they had ample time before them and were
not at all anxious to reach their destination.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jack&rsquo;s car, which was in advance,
came to a full stop. He turned about and motioned
for Cora to drive up as softly as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked as she drew up alongside.</p>
<p>For answer, Jack pointed ahead, and the girls
saw a big rattlesnake sunning himself in the road.</p>
<p>The girls gave a shriek that roused the snake.
He reared his ugly triangular head, saw the cars,
and with an angry rattle threw himself into position
for attack or defense as the case might call
for. His forked tongue played back and forth
like lightning and his wicked eyes sparkled with
rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beauty, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s get back!&rdquo; cried Belle. &ldquo;He may try
to climb into the car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A black snake does that sometimes, but a
rattler never does,&rdquo; declared Walter. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
leave us alone if we leave him alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, leave him alone, then!&rdquo;
pleaded Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get a closer look at him,&rdquo; said
Jack, preparing to jump from the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Jack, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Cora, and there
was such fear in his sister&rsquo;s voice that Jack yielded,
though reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to let him get away, are we?&rdquo;
he grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; replied Cora. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t doing
anything to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be killed on general principles,&rdquo;
said Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an enemy of the human race,&rdquo; added
Walter.</p>
<p>But this viewpoint did not appeal to the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a right to his life,&rdquo; said tender-hearted
Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure he has,&rdquo; acquiesced Belle. &ldquo;Besides,
you boys haven&rsquo;t any weapons, and you
might get bitten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are plenty of rocks and sticks around
here to kill him with,&rdquo; said Walter.</p>
<p>But the girls insisted, and while they were excitedly
talking, the snake himself, seeing that he
was not attacked, solved the matter by uncoiling
and gliding away into the bushes at the side of
the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A perfectly good bunch of rattles gone to
waste,&rdquo; said Jack disgustedly, as they prepared to
start on again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s given us a tip anyway to be on the lookout,&rdquo;
warned Walter. &ldquo;Where there&rsquo;s one there
may be others. Joel says they&rsquo;re not very plentiful
about here, but he does run across them
sometimes. I wonder what Joel would say if he
knew we had a chance to kill one and didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what Joel thinks,&rdquo; said Bess.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help handing it to the old boy for
pluck,&rdquo; said Jack, with grudging admiration. &ldquo;He
was ready to fight the whole six of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it had been a regiment, it would have been
just the same,&rdquo; remarked Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kept that old buzzer of his working overtime,&rdquo;
laughed Walter. &ldquo;No striking on the sly
for him. He keeps telling you just what he hopes
to do to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve met a rattler under such
circumstances, and I hope it will be the last,&rdquo; said
Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess his snakeship feels the same way about
us, so honors are even,&rdquo; laughed Paul.</p>
<p>The party kept a sharp lookout from that time
on, but no other snakes were encountered, and a
few minutes later the logging camp came into
view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">A MOMENTOUS STEP</span></h2>
<p>The camp, which consisted of a sawmill, an
immense bunk-house capable of accommodating
more than a hundred men, and a number of scattered
outbuildings, was picturesquely located in a
depression between two great hills. A mountain
stream that came tearing down the side of one of
the hills furnished power for the mill. Later on,
some of its waters would be diverted to the giant
flumes, down which the logs would come hurtling
to the valley below.</p>
<p>Just now it was by no means the scene of busy
life that it would become in the late fall and
throughout the winter. Then would come the
bearded lumberjacks, hardy, red-faced giants
of the woods, Swedes, Norwegians, Irishmen,
Frenchmen, hard workers, hard fighters, hard
drinkers, and the wood would ring with the clang
of axes and the crash of falling trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>At present there was little work going on. The
sawmill, with a small force of men, was running
in a languid sort of way, clearing up some of the
by-products of the season before. The camp
might be said to be in a state of suspended animation.</p>
<p>A sort of deputy foreman who was in charge
gave the party a cordial greeting and showed
them about the various points of interest, explaining
volubly the processes through which the lumber
passed from the standing tree to the shaped
and finished product of the mills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got only a small force working in the
woods just now,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re nicking
the trees, so that the men will know which ones
are to be cut down this coming fall and winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of passing sentence of death, as it were,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you might call it that,&rdquo; smiled the
foreman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems a pity that they should have to die,&rdquo;
said Cora, as her eyes took in the stately trees
that decked the mountain side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially after what Mr. Morley was saying
yesterday about the trees being alive,&rdquo; remarked
Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girls are the limit,&rdquo; laughed Paul. &ldquo;First
you let the snake go, and now you want to save
the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be afraid to pick a nosegay after a
while for fear that the flowers will bleed,&rdquo; mocked
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish my folks had believed in that plant
theory when I was a kid,&rdquo; drawled Walter. &ldquo;Then
I wouldn&rsquo;t have had to weed the garden for fear
of hurting the weeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a bit of poetry in you boys,&rdquo; said
Belle reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken there,&rdquo; denied Paul. &ldquo;We
love beautiful things. If we didn&rsquo;t we wouldn&rsquo;t
be chasing after you girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was only one other visitor to the camp,
a sharp-eyed reticent man, who loitered about
without betraying interest in anything especially.
He made no attempt to join the party, but kept
by himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is our unsociable friend over there?&rdquo; inquired
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the foreman. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
been hanging around off and on for several days.
He doesn&rsquo;t talk much to the men, but he and I
have chinned a little together. About all I know
of him is that his name is Baxter. He doesn&rsquo;t let
on about his business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s an author in search of local color,&rdquo;
hazarded Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely a detective,&rdquo; remarked Jack.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better look out, girls. He&rsquo;s closing in
upon you, knowing you are desperate criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>After the foreman had left them, they climbed
the slopes of the hill, and enjoyed the magnificent
view from the summit. Then, as it was nearing
noon, Jack suggested lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m keen to see what Aunt Betty has had put
up for us,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;and what I&rsquo;ll do to it
will be a sin and a shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out into the woods to eat it,&rdquo; suggested
Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this woods enough for you?&rdquo; asked Paul,
as he looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while we&rsquo;re in sight of the mill,&rdquo; returned
Cora. &ldquo;I want to go right out into the wild wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mightn&rsquo;t we get lost?&rdquo; inquired Belle rather
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier to get into the wilderness sometimes
than it is to get out of it,&rdquo; added Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s safe enough,&rdquo; remarked Jack. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t go very far, and I have a compass with me,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no further protest. The boys went
back to the cars and got the lunch basket. Then
they rejoined the girls, and the party plunged gaily
into the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;re going, but we&rsquo;re
on the way,&rdquo; chanted Walter.</p>
<p>There was a trail that had evidently been used
by the lumberjacks, and the walking was easy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>So easy, in fact, and the balsam in the air was
so stimulating and delightful, that the party had
gone a good deal farther than they had first intended
to before they came to a halt in a mossy
glade that seemed to be especially designed by
nature for a picnic party.</p>
<p>A little brook ran near by, and the boys brought
drinking water from this, while the girls brought
out the napkins and spread on them the host of
good things that Aunt Betty had had put up for
them.</p>
<p>There were no dyspeptics in the party, and the
food vanished in amazing fashion, to the accompaniment
of a running fire of chaff and jokes.</p>
<p>When the last crumb had disappeared, Walter
filled one of the drinking cups with the crystal
water and raised it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A toast,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I drink to Camp Kill
Kare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all responded merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to look around this place a little,&rdquo;
exclaimed Cora, rising to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just too comfortable to move,&rdquo; said Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; echoed Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re setting an example of pernicious activity,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go far,&rdquo; Cora assured him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>She strolled about for a little while, picking an
occasional flower and observing with interest the
nicks made in the trees by the woodchoppers. The
woods closed around her and shut her out of sight
of the others. But she gave no thought to this,
for she knew that they could locate her by a call,
even though she was invisible.</p>
<p>From the bushes in front of her, a mother bird
darted out and ran along the ground, twittering
sharply as though in pain or alarm. Cora gazed
at her, and noticed that her wing was trailing as
though broken.</p>
<p>Her sympathies were aroused in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little thing,&rdquo; she murmured to herself.
&ldquo;I wonder if I can&rsquo;t catch her and perhaps help
set that wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She followed the bird for some distance, but it
managed to keep just a little out of reach of her
outstretched hand.</p>
<p>So much of design appeared in this that at last
the truth dawned upon Cora, and she laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little fibber!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t any broken wing at all. You&rsquo;re just trying
to draw me away from your nest, so that I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t find your babies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To make sure that her guess was correct, she
followed the bird a little farther. Then the little
creature seemed to realize that she had accomplished
her object, and rising from the ground,
she soared swiftly away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sold!&rdquo; laughed Cora to herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
to tell the others about that. They&rsquo;ll have the
laugh on me, of course, but it&rsquo;s too good to keep.
But I&rsquo;d better go back or they&rsquo;ll begin to get worried
about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned in the direction of the picnic party,
as she thought, and began to walk rapidly. But
at the end of five minutes she saw no trace of
them and a vague uneasiness began to take possession
of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little cheat must have led me a good deal
farther than I thought,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;I
guess I&rsquo;d better call out to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sent out a loud yodel, such as she and the
other girls were accustomed to use as a call, and
waited expectantly for an answer.</p>
<p>But no answer came.</p>
<p>She repeated the call, but with the same result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be these trees,&rdquo; she assured herself.
&ldquo;They smother the sound so that it can&rsquo;t go more
than a few rods. I&rsquo;ll go on a little farther and
try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She almost ran now, stumbling occasionally in
her haste, and trying to crowd back an awful fear
that was rapidly taking form.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>Once more she stood still and called at the top
of her voice, called desperately, frantically, repeatedly.
But for all the response she received
she might as well have been in the center of the
Sahara desert.</p>
<p>Then she stumbled over a tree root and rolled
over and over down the mountain side, to bring
up at last in a wilderness of brushwood.</p>
<p>She was dazed for a few moments by the fall,
but soon realized that she was not hurt. She arose
and pushed her way in a zigzag course, trying to
mount the hillside down which she had fallen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">IN THE WILDERNESS</span></h2>
<p>Cora was lost!</p>
<p>For an hour past she had refused to admit it
to herself. The utmost that she would concede
was that she had become separated from her
party. But that of course often happened, was
bound to happen again and again, when one was
out in the woods.</p>
<p>Jack and the rest must be looking for her as
eagerly as she was for them. How heartily they
would laugh and joke over the needless fears that
had assailed her when she first realized that she
was alone.</p>
<p>So she had reasoned with herself, thrusting
resolutely into the background the terrible dread
that kept trying to get possession of her mind,
marshaling all the pathetic sophistries by which
those in similar plight have tried to delude themselves
from the beginning of the world. But with
every moment that passed she grew more certain
of the truth, until she seated herself on a fallen
tree, and, burying her face in her hands, gave
way to the tears she tried in vain to hold back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>There was no use in blinking the fact. She
was lost in the Adirondack wilderness, cut off for
the time being from her friends, doomed perhaps
to suffer incredible hardships before she should
be rescued. She shuddered as she recalled instances
of others, lost in that vast region, strong
men, some of them, for whom rescue had arrived
too late.</p>
<p>She pressed her fingers into her throbbing
temples and tried to think. But her head swam,
and it was only by a strong exertion of her will
that she was able to pull herself together. It was
some minutes before she had herself well in hand
and was able to bring all her powers to bear on
the problem before her. That problem had suddenly
assumed gigantic proportions. Unless she
solved it correctly, her life might pay the penalty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;What
shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>North, east, south, west, wherever she looked
she could see nothing resembling a trail. In all
that tangle of trees, rocks and undergrowth there
was no indication that the foot of man had ever
disturbed its solitude. And as Cora looked wildly
about her, the forest seemed to mock her with a
lurking smile as though taunting her helplessness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>But she resolutely crushed back the feeling of
panic that clutched at her heart and hunted about
desperately to get her bearings. It was ridiculous,
she told herself, that she should not find
something that would give her the needed clue.</p>
<p>She knew in a general way that the bungalow
lay a little north of east. It was not much to go
by, but if she could keep in that line it might make
all the difference between safety and disaster.</p>
<p>But how was she to find the cardinal points?
She had no compass with her. And then her
heart gave a great bound as she thought of her
watch!</p>
<p>Like all the Motor Girls, Cora, in her frequent
journeyings, had picked up a good many points
of woodcraft. Among others, she knew how by a
simple device to locate the south, and with this as
a starter find the other points of the compass.</p>
<p>Where she sat, the trees were so thick that a
perpetual twilight reigned beneath. A little to the
right, however, they thinned out somewhat, and
rays of light fell through the foliage. Here was
her chance to get an idea of the sun&rsquo;s location.</p>
<p>She went hurriedly to the spot and opening her
watch carefully turned it until the figure twelve
pointed directly at the sun. Then she measured
half the distance between twelve and the hour
hand and knew that this central point indicated
due south. Directly opposite, of course, was
north. Standing, then, with her face to the north,
it followed that the east was on her right hand
and the west on her left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>She had a tiny penknife with her, and with this
she cut two strips of bark and dovetailed them in
the form of a cross, so that each of the four ends
stood for one of the cardinal points. On these
she cut the appropriate initials and carefully
planted it in the ground at her feet. Then she
put back her watch with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Now she had at least a point of departure. All
she had to do was to start in the right direction
and depend upon further glimpses of the sun to
correct her course from time to time.</p>
<p>From the beginning her progress was slow,
owing to the absence of a trail and the necessity
of forcing her way through the underbrush. At
times she had to make a considerable detour, to
avoid brush so thickly matted that she could not
penetrate it. This of necessity threw her out of
the course she was trying to keep. And her consternation
was great to find, on reaching a more
open spot, that the sun was now hidden by thick
clouds.</p>
<p>Still she went doggedly on for two hours or
more, taxing every ounce of courage and resolution
that she possessed, finding a mental relief in
the physical effort that kept her from dwelling
too intently on her desperate plight. The afternoon
was rapidly waning and the gloom of the
forest was deepening into dusk. And just then,
panting with fatigue and exhaustion, her eye
caught something familiar close to her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>It was the cross of bark that she had made
two hours earlier!</p>
<p>This, then, was the reward of all her exertions.
Obeying that inexorable and malign law that seems
to hound desert and forest wanderers, she had
worked around in a circle to the very point from
which she had started!</p>
<p>For a moment it seemed to Cora that she must
be dreaming. She could not bring herself to admit
that all the toil and effort of the afternoon
had come only to this. It was absurd, ridiculous!
She rubbed her eyes and looked again. It was
only too surely the fact. There was the little
cross with the edges still raw from the blade of
her knife.</p>
<p>Fate had played a cruel joke on her&mdash;a joke
that might prove to be deadly. She had taxed
her muscles until she was dropping with weariness,
kept up her courage with the thought that she
was making progress, only to find that all was
utterly wasted, and that she was no nearer safety
than when she had started. The reaction came on
her with a rush and for a moment she thought
she was going to faint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Now, for the first time, the full horror of her
situation dawned on her. As long as she had
kept in motion, she had been buoyed up by the
thought that at any minute she might win her way
to safety. But now her chance, for the day at
least, was gone. She was alone, cut off from all
human companionship in that vast wilderness, and
night was coming on!</p>
<p>What was to be her fate? She had everything
to live for, youth, health, friends, home and love.
She was just on the brink of womanhood, and life
ran at full tide through her veins. The future
stretched before her, glowing with promise and
with hands heaped high with treasures. She was
just getting ready to drink the wine of life. Was
the cup to be dashed rudely to the ground, just
as she was lifting it to her lips?</p>
<p>For a little while she surrendered to these
gloomy imaginings. The shock had been too
severe for her to rally all at once. Then she
took a grip on herself.</p>
<p>For it was not in Cora&rsquo;s nature to yield tamely
to despair. Her heart was naturally brave and
she came of fighting stock. It was good red blood
that ran in Cora&rsquo;s veins, and now, as the first depression
passed, it began to assert itself.</p>
<p>Not that she attempted longer to deceive herself.
She admitted that her plight was desperate.
But it was not hopeless. It never would be that,
she told herself, as long as a spark of life was
left. She would work, plan, struggle and never
give up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>But where would she find shelter for the night?
In some dense thicket? In a hollow tree? She
shuddered as she thought of spending the night
entirely in the open. What wild animals might be
abroad, coming out, soft-footed and wary, to make
their nightly kill? She knew that there were bears,
wolves and lynxes in these forests, and also rattlesnakes.
Without anything approaching a weapon,
what chance would she have in case of attack?</p>
<p>If she only had some matches! None of the
beasts would dare to touch her if she were seated
close to a roaring fire. They might prowl about
and eye her hungrily, but no matter how famished
or savage they were, they would not venture into
that zone of flame.</p>
<p>But a fire was impossible. And as Cora realized
this, she looked about her wildly, as though
she expected even in the twilight to hear a stealthy
footfall or see a pair of phosphorescent eyes glaring
at her. She could almost hear the pounding
of her heart.</p>
<p>She must find shelter in the few minutes of
daylight that remained. There was nothing to
gain and everything to lose by staying where she
was. With a little prayer on her lips, she set off,
choosing no particular direction, but trusting to
Providence to direct her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Five minutes later she gave a joyous cry, and
ran forward to a tiny hut that stood in a little
clearing.</p>
<p>It was a rude cabin of a single room.
Its weather-beaten and dilapidated appearance
showed that it had been knocked together a long
time previously, probably by some trapper or
hunter. Part of the thatched roof had sagged in,
leaving rifts open to the sky.</p>
<p>On the earthen floor within were the ashes of
a fire and several rusty pans and skillets, abandoned
or forgotten by the last occupant. In the
center was a bunk, consisting of four uprights, to
which were fastened ropes that crossed and criss-crossed
each other to form a rough mattress. A
door swung loosely from the rusted hinges.</p>
<p>From all appearances, no one had been in the
place for years. Cora rushed inside, pulled the
door shut and slipped a bar that she found within
into place. Then she sat down on the cord mattress
and cried with thankfulness.</p>
<p>From all the terrors of a night spent in the open
forest she was safe.</p>
<p>Night had fully fallen now, and the myriad
voices of the forest were in full swing. It was
nature&rsquo;s symphony on a colossal scale. Locusts,
crickets and katydids sought to outdo each other.
From the trees came the hoot of owls and the
mournful notes of the whippoorwill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Now that she was temporarily safe, Cora was
conscious of being hungry. She had been so absorbed
in her attempt to escape from the captivity
of the forest that she had not even thought of
food. Now she realized that her healthy appetite
was clamoring for satisfaction.</p>
<p>Suddenly she remembered that she had slipped
a tablet of chocolate in the pocket of her blouse
that morning, to nibble at on the trip. She had
forgotten all about it till now, and she thanked the
fates for the oversight.</p>
<p>She drew it out, and as she did so she felt two
other objects that she had not known were there.
She drew them out and found that they were two
cubes of compressed soup stock, wrapped in little
pieces of waxed paper.</p>
<p>How on earth had they gotten there? Some
trick played by Bess or Belle probably. They
had slipped them in when she had not been looking,
just for the sake of seeing her perplexed expression
when she should discover them. That
must be the explanation.</p>
<p>Her spirits rose with the discovery. If she
could only have had a can of water and a fire,
she could have made a delicious soup. But this
was out of the question, and she had to content
herself with putting one of the precious cubes in
her mouth and letting it slowly dissolve. It was
rather dry eating, but the nourishment was there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>She was sorely tempted to let the other cube and
the tablet of chocolate take the same course, as
all of them together would have made but a
slender meal. But prudence spoke more loudly
than appetite and she crushed down the temptation.
Although it taxed her resolution sorely, she
thrust them back into her pocket.</p>
<p>She lay down on the rude mattress, although she
was sure that she would not close her eyes the
whole night through. But she was utterly used
up by the terrible strain of the day&rsquo;s experience,
and tired nature demanded her rights. Sleep laid
its soothing fingers on her eyelids, and all her
troubles were, for the time being, forgotten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">CONSTERNATION</span></h2>
<p>It may have been the drowsy charm of the day,
the soothing murmur of the brook, or the satisfying
quality of the lunch, or perhaps a combination
of the three, that made the little party under the
trees so content to sit still or lie still for a considerable
time after Cora left them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is <i>dolce far niente</i> for fair,&rdquo; murmured
Jack lazily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d agree with you,&rdquo; drawled Paul, &ldquo;if I only
knew what you meant. Talk United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it means something like &lsquo;the happiness of
doing nothing,&rsquo; I believe,&rdquo; explained Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to make a hit with you,&rdquo; remarked
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; admitted Jack brazenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, you boys are like so many stuffed
anacondas stretched out there,&rdquo; observed Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re members of the Amalgamated Order
of the Sons of Rest,&rdquo; said Walter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Belle,&rdquo; said Bess, rising. &ldquo;If we
stay here much longer we&rsquo;ll grow to be as lazy
as they are. Let&rsquo;s go and find Cora. She&rsquo;s the
only real live wire in the whole party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do yourselves an injustice,&rdquo; Jack called
after them.</p>
<p>The girls went off in the direction that Cora had
taken, keeping a sharp lookout as they went
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer that she hasn&rsquo;t come back of her
own accord by this time,&rdquo; remarked Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably gathering flowers,&rdquo; replied
Bess. &ldquo;There are so many beautiful varieties
around here.&rdquo; But Belle grew more uneasy every
second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to call her,&rdquo; she said, and gave the
familiar yodel on which Cora herself had relied
in vain.</p>
<p>But no answer came back, and the girls looked
at each other with unrest in their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s teasing us by pretending
not to hear?&rdquo; asked Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied her sister, &ldquo;that wouldn&rsquo;t be like
Cora. She knows how that would worry us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try both together,&rdquo; suggested Belle, and
they gave out a call in unison.</p>
<p>Again there was no response, and thoroughly
frightened now, the girls ran back to their companions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack,&rdquo; exclaimed Belle, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t find
Cora!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the boys, leaping to their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; confirmed Bess. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve called her
again and again, and we can&rsquo;t get any answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack grew pale beneath his coat of tan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t call loud
enough. Cora, oh, Cora!&rdquo; he shouted at the top
of his voice.</p>
<p>Paul and Walter joined in with stentorian yells,
but their united efforts had no result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s got to be some quick work here, fellows!&rdquo;
cried Jack, a cold perspiration breaking
out all over him. &ldquo;You girls stay right here,&rdquo; he
commanded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stir from this spot. We
three fellows will spread out in a semicircle, and
beat up the woods in the general direction that
Cora started out in. We&rsquo;ll spread out as widely
as we can, but we mustn&rsquo;t get so far apart that we
can&rsquo;t hear each other shout. We&rsquo;ll keep calling
out all the time, so as to keep in touch with each
other. If at the end of half an hour we haven&rsquo;t
found any trace of her, we&rsquo;ll know that she isn&rsquo;t
in this section and we&rsquo;ll hurry back to the girls
here. Then we&rsquo;ll raise a hue and cry and get the
whole district out searching for her. Come along
now and keep your voices going. And keep your
eyes open, too. She may have met with an accident.
Work, fellows! Work like mad!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>The others needed no urging, for they were
wild with fear for Cora&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>For the next half-hour they yelled until they
were hoarse, and covered as much territory as
they could. They peered into every bush and
thicket. Not one of them but thought of the ugly
monster they had seen in the road that morning.
Suppose one of this tribe had attacked the girl
who was so dear to all of them? Suppose at that
very moment she were lying somewhere helpless
and dying?</p>
<p>They looked everywhere in an agony of apprehension,
but Cora&rsquo;s wandering feet and her fall
down the mountainside had already carried her
far beyond sound or sight.</p>
<p>At the appointed time they rejoined the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; announced Jack, in a voice that he
tried to keep firm, despite the working of his features.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do. You stay
here, Paul, until further notice. If Cora comes
back, you have an easy trail from here to the
mill. There&rsquo;s a telephone there, and of course
you&rsquo;d call up Kill Kare at once with the good
news. Walter and I will go back with Bess and
Belle to the mill. Then Walter can drive the
girls to Kill Kare in one of the cars, leave them
with Aunt Betty, and bring Joel back with him to
the mill. I&rsquo;ll get all the men that I can at the
mill to join in the search. Those lumberjacks
know the woods thoroughly. Then, too, I&rsquo;ll telephone
to all the neighboring towns and camps and
call for volunteers. We&rsquo;ll comb these woods all
day and all night until we find her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>He and Walter hurried off with the girls, leaving
Paul behind. They reached the sawmill in
record time, and leaving Jack there to explain the
situation and carry out the plans agreed upon,
Walter drove the girls home.</p>
<p>It had been thought at first that it would be well
to leave Aunt Betty in ignorance of the affair, in
order to spare her misery. But on second
thought this idea had been dismissed. It would not
be fair to her, in a matter of such moment, to
treat her as a child, even with the best of motives.
Besides it was morally certain that the girls
would not be able to conceal their grief from her,
no matter how hard they tried.</p>
<p>She was waiting for them as they drove up and
greeted them with her usual kindly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the others?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;And
what on earth is the matter with you two girls?&rdquo;
she added in quick alarm as she saw their eyes
red and swollen with weeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, Aunt Betty,&rdquo; said Walter,
as lightly as he could. &ldquo;The girls are a little worried
because Cora strayed off a little way into the
woods and we haven&rsquo;t found her. But she can&rsquo;t
have gone very far, and we&rsquo;ll find her and have
her back to Kill Kare in a jiffy. Jack and Paul
are looking for her now, and I&rsquo;m going back to
help them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Aunt Betty gave a frightened exclamation and
put her hand to her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cora lost!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;And in those
awful woods! Oh, why did you let her get away
from you? The poor darling girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We boys ought to be kicked from here to
Jericho for letting her out of our sight,&rdquo; said
Walter in savage self-reproach. &ldquo;But the mischief&rsquo;s
done now, and we&rsquo;ve got to remedy it as
best we can. You take care of the girls, Aunt
Betty, while I go and hunt up Joel. I&rsquo;m going
to take him back with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried away, leaving the three to condole
with each other. He was lucky enough to find
Joel in the barn, and hastily explained the state
of affairs.</p>
<p>The big backwoodsman was thoroughly
alarmed. Better than any one else at Kill Kare,
he knew the dangers that threatened any tyro that
ventured into that wilderness. There had been
cases within his own knowledge where hapless
wanderers had perished, even while the woods
were alive with searching parties.</p>
<p>He put his hunting knife in his belt, grasped
his rifle and hurried back with Walter to the
sawmill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Meanwhile, Jack told his story to the foreman,
and received his instant sympathy and promise to
help. He called for volunteers, and a number of
the men who were working in the mill responded
promptly. Some of them had already started out
when Walter arrived, and others quickly followed.</p>
<p>Baxter too was stirred by the story and came
out of his shell of reticence. He volunteered to
take charge of the telephoning, leaving Jack to
go out with the searching parties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know personally the authorities in the nearest
towns,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;ll be glad to oblige
me in this. You&rsquo;re too excited and on edge to
stay here, and I don&rsquo;t wonder. You go ahead and
look for your sister and leave this to me. Before
long I&rsquo;ll have a dozen parties out on the
trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack gladly availed himself of the offer, and, in
company with Walter and Joel, hurried with
feverish haste up the hillside and plunged into the
woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">HELP FROM THE SKY</span></h2>
<p>It was full day when Cora awoke.</p>
<p>For a moment she looked around her, dazed.
Then, as she realized where she was, she sprang
from the rope mattress to the floor. All the
events of the previous day rushed over her mind
like a flood.</p>
<p>She was greatly rested and refreshed, although
her muscles ached from contact with the rude mattress
on which she had slept.</p>
<p>A sickening sense of her position sought to take
possession of her, but she resolutely thrust it
back. She would not begin this new day by being
a coward.</p>
<p>She looked at her watch, but in the excitement
of the day before she had forgotten to wind it,
and it had stopped. She set it at a guess, and
held it up to her ear a moment before she returned
it to its place. Its lively ticking seemed to say:
&ldquo;Cheer up! cheer up! cheer up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>She threw open the door and stepped outside.
The sun had risen and was flooding the wilderness
with glory. The cool morning air was delicious
with the odor of the pines. She drank it
in in great draughts, and it put new life and hope
into her.</p>
<p>There was no sign of a stream anywhere near,
and her ablutions had to be scanty. She found a
little pool of water in a slight depression, and was
able to wash her face and hands. She did not
dare to drink of the standing water, but its external
use refreshed her. Then she thought of
breakfast.</p>
<p>It seemed a grim joke to call it that, when her
whole food supply consisted of a soup cube and a
chocolate tablet. But she hunted around in the
vicinity of the cabin, and found some blackberry
bushes that were fairly well laden. She picked the
berries with great care, for she knew how fond
snakes were of such localities, and she had a lively
memory of the encounter with the rattlesnake the
day before.</p>
<p>The berries and the chocolate tablet furnished
her morning meal. It was not a substantial or
satisfying one, and it required considerable self-control
not to supplement it with the remaining
soup cube. But after looking at it longingly, she
put it back in her pocket. A time might come
when it would be worth a king&rsquo;s ransom to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>And now that she had eaten, Cora bent all her
thoughts on the problem of escape.</p>
<p>What ought she to do? Ought she to leave
the cabin that had proved an ark of safety and
try once more to find her way through the trackless
woods? Suppose night came on again, and
she still found herself not only in the woods but
far from the cabin.</p>
<p>Or would it be wiser to stay right where she
was until her friends should find her? She knew
perfectly well how desperately they were hunting
for her. Her heart ached as she realized the
agony they were suffering. She could see the wild
distress on the features of Jack and the other boys,
the tear-stained faces of Bess and Belle. She
knew that by this time they would have raised a
hue and cry that would set scores of people searching
for her. Would they not have as good a
chance of finding her where she was as anywhere
else in the woods? In fact, would not some of
the lumberjacks know of this lonely cabin in the
forest, and think perhaps that she had sought
refuge there?</p>
<p>To stay where she was meant inaction, the hardest
thing in the world for her just then. She
would have nothing to do but to think, and she
would eat her heart out with anxiety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>On the other hand, she faced the perils of the
woods if she left the shelter of the cabin. Bears
and panthers roamed the forest in the daytime as
well as at night. Lynxes and wildcats, too, though
less dangerous, were not to be despised, and there
was the ever-present danger of snakes.</p>
<p>While she was pondering the best plan to pursue,
she heard the humming of a motor.</p>
<p>She jumped to her feet in wild delight. Could
that be the motor of a car with people searching
for her? It must be. What else could it be?</p>
<p>But the next instant she realized, with a sinking
of the heart, that no car could possibly penetrate
those tangled woods.</p>
<p>Still the strident buzz persisted. It was a motor.
She was too familiar with the sound to be mistaken.</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet, and as she did so a
branch caught in the veil that was wound round
her hat. She reached up to disentangle it, and her
eyes rested on a tiny spot in the sky that was not
a cloud, and that was momentarily growing larger.</p>
<p>Then she understood.</p>
<p>The motor was that of an aeroplane!</p>
<p>She ran to a more open spot where she could
get a better view.</p>
<p>The aircraft was flying at a height of perhaps
a thousand feet, and was moving at a high rate
of speed. Nearer and nearer it came from out
of the west, while Cora watched it with fascinated
eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Here was something that spoke of the great
world that she seemed to have left behind. It was
a link that brought her once more, if only for a
moment, in contact with civilization.</p>
<p>And up there on a precarious perch, a mere
atom in the blue immensity of the sky, was the
aviator. How Cora envied him! No forest held
<i>him</i> in its iron clutch. He was free as the bird
whom he resembled in his flight. He could choose
what path he would. He was free while she was
a prisoner. Perhaps he was flying now straight
toward friends and home and love. His roving
eyes could perhaps at that moment see Camp Kill
Kare, which she perhaps might never see again.</p>
<p>She dashed the tears from her eyes and
looked again.</p>
<p>Now the aviator was flying lower. And his
speed had perceptibly lessened. What did it
mean? Was he seeking a more favorable current
of air? Was he in doubt as to his course?</p>
<p>Louder and louder grew the buzz of the motor,
and lower and lower came the plane. Like a giant
bird, it was now describing great circles, and with
every one its distance from the earth was lessened.</p>
<p>Cora&rsquo;s heart seemed as though it would leap
out of her body. There was no doubt now of the
aviator&rsquo;s intention. He was looking for a place
to descend!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>But where? If he came down anywhere near
where she was standing, he would be caught in
the trees. But somewhere there must be an open
spot that his keen eyes had descried, and it was
there that he intended to make a landing.</p>
<p>Cora ran in the direction indicated by the plane.</p>
<p>She had gone perhaps two hundred yards, when
she came to a large plateau which bore marks of
having been swept at some time by a fire. So
fierce had been the conflagration that trees and
undergrowth alike had been burned to ashes in the
holocaust. Even the stumps had crumbled into
ashes, and there were several places in the wide
expanse where a skillful aviator could make a
landing without danger of injuring his machine.</p>
<p>As Cora came out into the open she saw that
the choice had already been made. There was one
long, graceful swoop, and then the giant flyer
settled on the ground with scarcely a jar, ran for
fifty feet or so on its wheels and stopped.</p>
<p>The aviator climbed out, rather painfully, as
though cramped from long sitting. He rubbed
his legs and flung his arms about vigorously as
though to restore the circulation. Then he took
some tools from a box under the seat and began
to make some repairs in the motor.</p>
<p>His back was toward Cora, and the latter was
running across the field to him when she suddenly
stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Who knew what this man might be? She was
alone in this wilderness. Could she trust him?</p>
<p>But her hesitation was only momentary. Most
men were chivalrous.</p>
<p>The aviator was on his knees as she approached.
He heard her coming and sprang to his feet, very
visibly startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to startle you,&rdquo; panted Cora,
with an attempt to smile. &ldquo;I saw you come down
here and I ran over as fast as I could. I had to
see you, because I&rsquo;m lost out here in the woods,
and I was sure you would help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was of medium height. The garments in
which he was wrapped to protect him from the
intense cold of the upper air made it impossible
to tell whether his form was large or slender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor child!&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger in
great surprise and sympathy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid
to tell me all about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took off his hat, and Cora&rsquo;s startled eyes
saw two large braids of hair coiled tightly about
his head.</p>
<p><i>The aviator was a woman!</i></p>
<p>The next moment she had her arms about Cora,
and the latter was sobbing as though her heart
would break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, my dear,&rdquo; said the newcomer,
patting Cora&rsquo;s disheveled hair, &ldquo;go ahead and cry
all you want to. It will do you good, and I know
just how you feel. But you&rsquo;re all right now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>The revulsion from despair to joy had been so
great that it was some minutes before Cora recovered
her self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she exclaimed at last, as she smiled radiantly
through her tears, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy that I can
hardly bear it! Surely God has sent you to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; smiled the other, who herself
was a mere girl, not much older than Cora herself.
&ldquo;But now go ahead and tell me just how
you came to be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened with the greatest sympathy and
interest while Cora narrated all that had happened
to her since the day before.</p>
<p>Then in her turn she explained that she was
making a cross-country flight from Chicago to
New York. She was bent on beating the best
record ever made for the distance by either man
or woman, and was in a fair way to do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My engine began working badly a little while
ago,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;The ignition was balky and
I thought I&rsquo;d better come down and fix it before
it got worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora looked at her with admiration, and expressed
it warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you dare to take such risks,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;It must take a tremendous amount of
courage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the other modestly.
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a lot of satisfaction in beating the men
at their own game,&rdquo; she added mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We women all owe you a lot for doing it,&rdquo;
laughed Cora happily. &ldquo;It does the men good to
have some of the conceit taken out of them. But
just the same I startled you when I appeared so
suddenly at your side,&rdquo; she added, with a spark of
mischief in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted the other. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that
I was within miles of anybody at all you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; murmured Cora, but the sportive
look remained on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;ll just put the finishing touch on
the engine and then I&rsquo;ll be ready,&rdquo; said the aviatrix,
who had introduced herself as Ruth Moore.
&ldquo;And you shall go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me! With you?&rdquo; gasped Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why not? My machine has an extra
seat. And you want to get out of this wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Moore set to work, Cora assisting her,
and the aircraft was soon ready to continue its
flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d be taking my first ride in
an aircraft under such conditions,&rdquo; remarked Cora
as her companion strapped her in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you won&rsquo;t be afraid?&rdquo; asked Miss
Moore, looking at her searchingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy at getting away from these awful
woods that I&rsquo;m not afraid of anything,&rdquo; replied
Cora. &ldquo;Then, too, I&rsquo;m used to motor cars and
motor boats, and that ought to help me in keeping
my nerve. You needn&rsquo;t be afraid. I won&rsquo;t make
any fuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a girl after my own heart,&rdquo; laughed
Miss Moore, as she adjusted herself in her seat.
&ldquo;Sit perfectly still now and leave everything to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She touched a lever and the aeroplane ran along
a few yards and then soared skyward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">A JOYFUL REUNION</span></h2>
<p>Cora gasped as the aircraft mounted into the
sky and she saw the earth falling away from her.
It was the newest and greatest thrill in her experience.</p>
<p>Her first sensation was that of detachment. She
seemed to be floating in a sea of ether. Everything
was impalpable, intangible. It seemed to
be her astral body that was moving through space.
All that was material seemed to have been thrown
aside like a cast-off garment.</p>
<p>Her next impression was that of silence. All
earthly noises had been stilled. The song of birds,
the rustling of leaves that had made the forest
vocal had died away. It seemed as though the
world had been suddenly stricken dumb. The
only sound was that of the motor with its monotonous
hum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it?&rdquo; called out Miss Moore, looking at
her with a smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; replied Cora. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just heavenly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aviatrix gazed at her with approval. She
had found a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a thoroughbred,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Many
girls would be frightened to death. They&rsquo;d be
begging me to descend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of my doing that,&rdquo; laughed Cora.
&ldquo;I could go on like this forever, if I were not so
anxious to get back to my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were flying now at a height of five hundred
feet, and the air, despite the August sun, was
cold. Miss Moore had given Cora a coat and a
pair of gloves from her kit, however, so that she
was fairly well protected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a glorious view!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora ecstatically,
as the vast panorama of field and forest
unrolled itself as far as the eye could see.
&ldquo;Oh, how I envy you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Moore smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> beautiful,&rdquo; she assented. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m kept
so busy with listening to my engine and shaping
my course that I don&rsquo;t have as much time to enjoy
it as I would like to. That&rsquo;s one of the advantages
of being a passenger. But look around now,
and see if you can recognize your camp. I&rsquo;ll make
a landing as near to it as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora looked eagerly about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the sawmill!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;And
there&rsquo;s the road that leads from there to Kill
Kare,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;All you have to do is to
follow that road south for a few miles, and we&rsquo;ll
come to the house. And there&rsquo;s a big cleared
space around it that will make a splendid landing
place for the aeroplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Moore turned in the indicated direction,
and followed the road that Cora had pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can never thank you enough for rescuing me
as you have,&rdquo; said Cora, her voice broken with
emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s made me almost as happy as it has you,&rdquo;
returned Miss Moore. &ldquo;It will be one of the
pleasantest memories of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s delayed you on your trip, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose it has?&rdquo; replied Miss Moore. &ldquo;Do
you suppose I would have hesitated on that account
to bring you home? But set your mind at
rest on that score. I was an hour or more ahead
of my schedule anyway. You see,&rdquo; she added
gaily, &ldquo;we girls can give the men a handicap and
yet beat them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora laughed gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we can!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;But oh,
Miss Moore, there&rsquo;s dear old Kill Kare now!
See, over there among the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; was the reply, as Miss Moore&rsquo;s practised
eye looked out for the landing place.</p>
<p>She touched a lever and began to descend in a
sweeping curve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>When Jack and Walter, together with Joel,
reached the picnic ground, they found that Paul
had not been idle. He had been searching for
Cora in ever widening circles during every moment
of their absence, but a glance at his disconsolate
face showed that he had learned nothing.</p>
<p>Some of the workers from the mill had already
scattered in the woods, going in different directions.
Other volunteers came straggling in until
the number had reached a score. Joel, because
of his knowledge of the woods, was put in general
charge of the search.</p>
<p>Anticipating that Cora might not be found before
dark closed in, torches were prepared in
large numbers and distributed among the men. It
was arranged that the place where they now were
should be the general rendezvous, at which all
the searching parties would report, and to which
Cora should be brought as soon as found.</p>
<p>Most of the men had either rifles or revolvers,
and a copious supply of ammunition was furnished
by the foreman of the mill. Joel had brought
from the barn a number of skyrockets that had
been left over from the previous Fourth of July
celebration, and it was arranged that one of these
should be set off every hour through the night.
By following the course of this and marking the
direction from which it came, the searching parties
could keep the location of the camp in mind.
It was hoped also that Cora might see them and
thereby be guided in the right direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Paul had driven back to Kill Kare, and had secured
unlimited food and coffee for the refreshment
of the searchers, in case the hunt was prolonged.</p>
<p>All through the waning afternoon the search
continued. And with the coming of night it
doubled in intensity. Fresh parties took the place
of exhausted ones that came straggling back. The
woods were alive with torches.</p>
<p>It seemed certain that, with so many hunters,
success ought to have been almost certain. But
Joel knew that twenty times that number might
search in that vast wilderness without running
across the one they sought. At best it was a gamble,
with the odds against them.</p>
<p>Morning came and found the boys fairly dropping
with fatigue and torn with grief and disappointment.
Jack was almost out of his mind with
reflecting on his sister&rsquo;s plight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drive back to Kill Kare and telegraph
for bloodhounds,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Joel says that there
are a couple he knows of at the county seat. If
they&rsquo;re sent on the early train to the nearest town
they ought to get here by noon. We&rsquo;ll put them
to work at once, and see what they can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left Joel in charge of the search, and
drove back gloomily to Camp Kill Kare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>There was plenty of &ldquo;care&rdquo; there that morning.
Neither Aunt Betty nor the girls had been
able to sleep. The thought of Cora out in the
wilderness all through that long night had driven
them fairly frantic.</p>
<p>And their hearts sank still further when the
boys came back to report their failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to telegraph to your mother at
once,&rdquo; declared Aunt Betty, wringing her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would almost kill mother to get a telegram
like that,&rdquo; said Jack moodily. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do
any good, and in the meantime Cora may be
found. We&rsquo;ll wait, anyway, until after we&rsquo;ve
tried the bloodhounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ate briefly and scantily of breakfast, for
none of them had any heart for food. Then they
went outside to make ready for their trip to the
rendezvous.</p>
<p>The boys were piling into the car when Belle
gave a sudden exclamation and pointed upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an aeroplane!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>They followed her gaze and saw the aircraft
coming toward them at a rapid rate.</p>
<p>As they looked, they saw that it was beginning
to slacken speed and at the same time was coming
closer to earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though it were going to land somewhere
about here,&rdquo; remarked Jack. &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s
having trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>As it drew closer they could see that there were
two people in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one of them&rsquo;s a woman!&rdquo; cried Walter,
as he noted the fluttering of a skirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s waving at us!&rdquo; exclaimed Belle excitedly.
Then her voice rose to a scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Cora! It&rsquo;s Cora!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cora!&rdquo; shrieked Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cora!&rdquo; echoed Aunt Betty.</p>
<p>As for the boys, they gave one look and tumbled
out of the automobile, yelling, shouting, thumping
each other on the back. The girls sobbed and
laughed, and hugged Aunt Betty and each other.
None of them had the least idea of what they were
doing or saying, and none of them cared. They
were fairly mad with joy.</p>
<p>They ran out under the plane as it circled
around looking for its landing. And when it settled
down as gracefully as a swan and finally
stopped, there was a wild rush for it, and the next
second Cora was unstrapped, dragged from her
seat and was being devoured with hugs and kisses.</p>
<p>It was all incoherent and frantic and broken,
as great revulsions of feeling have a way of being.
It was impossible to find words adequate
to their delight, and it is safe to say that at that
moment there was no happier group of people
than that which wept and laughed on the lawn at
Camp Kill Kare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>The aviatrix sat looking on through all this
tumult with a happy smile.</p>
<p>As soon as Cora could extricate herself from the
arms that clung about her as though they never
intended to let her go, she turned to her deliverer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see what you have done for me,&rdquo; she
laughed through her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly seem glad to see you,&rdquo; was the
response.</p>
<p>They all crowded around and showered her
rescuer with thanks, as Cora introduced them.
They were astounded to find that it was to a
woman that Cora owed her safety. Most of them
had heard her name in connection with flying exploits,
and they were earnest in their compliments
and congratulations.</p>
<p>When a few minutes later Miss Moore resumed
her flight, every eye remained fixed on the
plane until at last it melted into space. Then they
resumed their rejoicings over the wanderer who
had been so strangely brought back from the wilderness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">GOOD NEWS TRAVELS FAST</span></h2>
<p>A perfect delirium of happiness reigned at
Kill Kare that morning. From being an abode of
deep gloom, it had suddenly been transformed into
a corner of Paradise.</p>
<p>For Cora was back again! Here she was, a
little trembly about the mouth, a little teary about
the eyes, her hands and arms bearing the marks of
scratches where they had come in contact with
thorns, her garments torn from pushing her way
through the underbrush, but with no damage that
a warm bath and a good breakfast and a long
sleep would not repair.</p>
<p>They brought her in triumph into the house and
seated her at the breakfast table that they had
just deserted, while Aunt Betty and the maid hurried
about to prepare her something hot and comforting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to go to my room first and freshen up
and change my clothes,&rdquo; the girl objected, her
purely feminine instincts coming to the fore, now
that she was once more in touch with civilization.
&ldquo;I must look a perfect fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just at this moment you are the most beautiful
thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; declared her brother fervently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; confirmed Walter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
been wanting to see you so badly that now we can&rsquo;t
bear to take our eyes off you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to get out of our sight again
in a hurry,&rdquo; maintained Paul.</p>
<p>As for Bess and Belle, their voices broke so
when they tried to speak that they had to content
themselves with pats and hugs.</p>
<p>As for Aunt Betty, she went around hardly
knowing, as she declared, whether she was awake
or dreaming, while she laughed and cried at the
same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a hideous nightmare as this has been!&rdquo;
ejaculated Jack, as he hugged his sister for the
twentieth time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be nearly starved to death, you poor
darling!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you had anything to eat since yesterday
noon?&rdquo; asked Belle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough to give me indigestion,&rdquo; laughed
Cora&mdash;she could laugh now, though a few hours
before she had thought she could never laugh
again. &ldquo;A soup cube and a chocolate tablet can
hardly be called overfeeding, though I did have a
few blackberries to help out. But even at that I
have some provisions left,&rdquo; and she took the remaining
soup cube out of her pocket.</p>
<p>Bess pounced upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the two I slipped into your pocket
for a joke yesterday morning!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a very lucky joke for me,&rdquo; smiled Cora.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have this one framed as a memento
of my escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something more nourishing and
abundant before her now, and she did it full justice,
while the others looked on happily.</p>
<p>Then, when she had partially satisfied her hunger,
questions poured in upon her in a flood, and
she had to narrate all the details of her experience
from the moment she had been beguiled by the
shamming mother bird to the never-to-be-forgotten
moment when she had heard the humming of
the aircraft motor in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If help ever came from heaven it did that
time!&rdquo; she said tremulously, and they all agreed
with her most fervently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, oh, girls,&rdquo; she said to Bess and Belle, &ldquo;if
you only knew how I felt when she spoke, and, almost
at the same moment, I saw those two braids
on the aviator&rsquo;s head and realized that I was talking
to a woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know,&rdquo; the girls assured her soothingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dandy!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet she is!&rdquo; declared Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s as plucky as they make &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Paul.
&ldquo;I only hope she beats the record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be there at Governor&rsquo;s Island to
greet her when she comes down,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if she puts the men in the shade by beating
their time?&rdquo; asked Bess mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; said Jack stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cora&rsquo;s got the start on all of us now,&rdquo; laughed
Bess. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re only motor girls but now she&rsquo;s an
aviator girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you frightened just a tiny bit when
you felt yourself going up in the air?&rdquo; asked Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; replied Cora. &ldquo;Possibly I might
have been if the circumstances had been different.
But I was so delighted to get away from those
dreadful woods that nothing else mattered. I
think I&rsquo;d have ridden on a lion&rsquo;s back, if he&rsquo;d
promised to bring me home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls took charge of Cora now, and although
the boys remonstrated, she was borne
away to her room to rest and bathe and change
her clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Jack, drawing a long breath,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s up to us to get busy and call off the searching
parties. I suppose I ought to have done it the
moment Cora landed, but for the life of me I
couldn&rsquo;t tear myself away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re excusable,&rdquo; laughed Walter. &ldquo;But you
stay right at home, old man, with your sister.
Paul and I will get on the job and attend to
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack protested, but they would take no denial.
They jumped into the car and whizzed down to the
sawmill.</p>
<p>They found the foreman and Baxter deep in
consultation. The latter saw at once from the
boys&rsquo; faces that they had good news, and hurried
to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got her!&rdquo; cried Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe and sound at Kill Kare,&rdquo; added Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; exclaimed the foreman with
a broad smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; cried Baxter in great relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find her?&rdquo; asked the foreman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t find her at all,&rdquo; grinned Paul. &ldquo;She
found us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came back by the sky route,&rdquo; chuckled Walter.</p>
<p>Then, as they saw the mystified looks, they
hastened to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That aeroplane!&rdquo; exclaimed Baxter. &ldquo;We
were watching it fly over here a little while ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was too far up for us to see that there were
two in it,&rdquo; remarked the foreman. &ldquo;Well, I guess
Miss Kimball can claim that she&rsquo;s the only person
that has ever been brought out of the woods in
any such way as that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And by a woman aviator, too,&rdquo; observed Baxter.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had much faith in women taking
up flying, but I&rsquo;m glad now they have. It beats
the Dutch what the women are doing these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll make us men take to cover if we don&rsquo;t
watch out,&rdquo; laughed Walter. &ldquo;But now we&rsquo;ve got
to hustle and call off the men who are beating the
woods. We can&rsquo;t thank you folks enough for all
you have done for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to leave some money with you to
pay the men for their trouble and time,&rdquo; added
Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a cent,&rdquo; said the foreman decidedly.
&ldquo;Their wages go on just the same, and they&rsquo;d
only feel hurt if you offered it. It&rsquo;s just a case
of common humanity, and they&rsquo;ve all been glad
to volunteer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have a big
open air spread on the lawn at Kill Kare to celebrate
Miss Kimball&rsquo;s safe return, and we want all
the sawmill crew up there to the last man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; grinned the foreman.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all come to that. But you&rsquo;re taking
a pretty big contract if you undertake to give a
spread to my lumberjacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t frighten us,&rdquo; laughed Walter.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fill them up to the chin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Baxter undertook to telephone the news to all
those whom he had previously called upon for
help, and the boys, leaving their car at the mill,
hastened to the rendezvous in the forest.</p>
<p>Joel was in charge, and a number of weary
searchers who had dragged themselves in were sitting
about, munching sandwiches and drinking
coffee.</p>
<p>The boys whooped out a yodel as soon as they
came in sight, and waved their hats.</p>
<p>The men jumped to their feet, and Joel came
running out to meet the bearers of good news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the good Lord!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he
saw their jubilant faces. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to ask
what&rsquo;s happened. You&rsquo;ve found &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got her,&rdquo; beamed Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; wuzn&rsquo;t she hurt none?&rdquo; asked Joel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a few scratches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men crowded round with eager questions,
and their delight was unbounded, for none knew
better than they what risks Cora had run in those
trackless woods.</p>
<p>One of the men volunteered to stay behind and
notify the other searchers as they should come in,
and then, with hearts light as thistledown, the
boys and Joel retraced their steps to the mill,
jumped into the car and &ldquo;burned up&rdquo; the road on
the way to Kill Kare.</p>
<p>They had gone perhaps half the distance when
they saw a figure on the side of the road that
somehow seemed familiar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>They slowed up a little as the man approached,
and then Paul gave a low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that old pirate that took the gypsy girl
away from us the other morning!&rdquo; he ejaculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; replied Walter, as he took a closer
look. &ldquo;I wonder what the old rascal is doing
around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to no good, I&rsquo;ll be bound,&rdquo; remarked Joel,
his old antipathy toward the vagrant people
asserting itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to speak to him,&rdquo; said Paul,
who was driving, as he slowed up a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; replied Walter. &ldquo;You
won&rsquo;t get anything out of him that he doesn&rsquo;t
want to tell you. And that&rsquo;ll be mighty little, or
I miss my guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gypsy had looked up as the car approached,
and it was apparent that he had recognized the
boys, for the same scowl came over his face that
they had seen on the first occasion of meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, friend,&rdquo; said Paul, as the car stopped
close beside the gypsy.</p>
<p>The man looked at him sullenly, but did not
respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your camp anywhere around here?&rdquo; asked
Walter.</p>
<p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No understand,&rdquo; he said blankly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>They tried again with the same result, and as
there was evidently no chance of getting an answer,
they drove on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;d promised to give him a five dollar
bill, he&rsquo;d have understood all right,&rdquo; laughed
Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s prospecting around to find a good
location for the camp,&rdquo; observed Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time then to put double locks on houses
and barns,&rdquo; growled Joel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hoped thet I&rsquo;d
never see hide nur hair uv them light-fingered
varmints ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">AN UNINVITED GUEST</span></h2>
<p>Cora was not visible when the party drove up
to the bungalow, for Aunt Betty and the girls
had put her to bed, with strict injunctions that she
should stay there for the rest of the day. She
had objected at first, but at last had yielded. And
to tell the truth, she was not sorry to yield to their
gentle compulsion, for although she was little the
worse physically from her adventure, she had been
under a terrific nervous strain that had taxed her
heavily.</p>
<p>But she appeared at supper time, fresh and radiant,
her eyes sparkling and her spirits high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare it&rsquo;s almost worth being lost for the
sake of being made so much of when one gets
back,&rdquo; she declared, with a loving look round at
the circle of friends, who could scarcely take their
eyes off her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we make much of one who
comes to us straight from the skies?&rdquo; said Walter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one less angel up there now,&rdquo; added
Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t let me catch you running away
again, sis,&rdquo; said Jack, with mock severity. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
forgive you this time, but once is plenty. I don&rsquo;t
know but what I ought to put a ball and chain on
you as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; answered Cora. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
cured. I&rsquo;ll stick to the rest of you now closer
than your shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; remarked Walter, as he passed
his plate, &ldquo;we met an old friend of yours on our
way back from the mill this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; asked Cora with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give you three guesses,&rdquo; teased Paul.</p>
<p>She ventured several names and then gave it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that dark-skinned gypsy who interfered
the other morning, when you girls were going
to have your fortunes told,&rdquo; said Walter.</p>
<p>Cora was all interest in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you see the girl?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t along,&rdquo; replied Paul. &ldquo;The man
was all by his lonesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A regular brigand he was, too,&rdquo; commented
Walter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to meet him at night in a dark
alley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tried to talk to him,&rdquo; explained Paul, &ldquo;but
he shut up like a clam. Pretended he couldn&rsquo;t
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of the gypsies can&rsquo;t be far off,&rdquo; observed
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fine if they camped somewhere
in this neighborhood?&rdquo; said Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they would,&rdquo; replied Cora. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy
to have another talk with that gypsy girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Joel doesn&rsquo;t share your sentiments,&rdquo;
laughed Walter. &ldquo;To speak of gypsy to him is
like waving a red rag at a bull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not very likely to settle down here,&rdquo;
declared Jack. &ldquo;They usually pitch their tents
somewhere in the vicinity of a town, so that they
can have plenty of visitors. The nearest place to
this spot they&rsquo;d be likely to fix on is Wilton.
That&rsquo;s quite a good-sized town, and there&rsquo;s a big
summer hotel there. But that&rsquo;s as much as four
miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s distance to us as long as we have the
cars?&rdquo; said Cora. &ldquo;For that matter, it wouldn&rsquo;t
be too far to walk. I wish you boys would keep
your eyes and ears open and let us know if you
find out anything about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They promised readily, but several days passed
without any scrap of news from the wandering
tribe.</p>
<p>One other bit of news, however, gave them
unqualified pleasure. They learned from a paper
that Jack secured on a trip to a neighboring town
that Miss Moore had safely landed at Governor&rsquo;s
Island and had broken all records for a cross-country
flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora, clapping
her hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been worrying ever since that
morning for fear I&rsquo;d caused her to lose, and I
know how much her mind was set on winning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And forthwith she dispatched a telegram, care
of the Aero Club, that read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your grateful passenger sends warmest love
and congratulations.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it may well be guessed that few of the
messages that overwhelmed Miss Moore on the
completion of her wonderful feat brought her
more real satisfaction than this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pining away for a trip on the lake,&rdquo; announced
Belle, one beautiful morning a few days
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s picnic up at the farther end of the lake,&rdquo;
said Cora. &ldquo;I noticed the loveliest spot for an
outing the last time we were up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wish is our command,&rdquo; said Jack with
exaggerated courtesy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have suggested it before,
if I hadn&rsquo;t thought you girls might feel a wee
bit nervous about the <i>Water Sprite</i> after the narrow
escape we had last time. But we&rsquo;ve spent a
good deal of time in fixing her up since then, and
now she&rsquo;s perfectly safe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not a bit afraid,&rdquo; was the unanimous
verdict of the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let&rsquo;s get a few fish on the way,&rdquo; said
Walter. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that tastes better than
a fish fry under the trees. And I know a way of
broiling them on oak twigs that will make you
think you&rsquo;re eating ambrosia. I&rsquo;ll be chef and
Jack and Paul can clean the fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a chance!&rdquo; exclaimed Paul. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do
your share of the cleaning, and don&rsquo;t you forget
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better catch the fish before you fall to
scrapping over them,&rdquo; remarked Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys go ahead and get your bait,&rdquo; commanded
Belle, &ldquo;while we get on our boating suits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We fellows seem to be unanimously elected to
do all the work,&rdquo; remarked Jack. &ldquo;I suppose you
girls will want us to put the worms on the hooks
for you, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely enough,&rdquo; admitted Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worms, little boys?&rdquo; sniffed Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bent pins, too, for hooks,&rdquo; suggested Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worms make a perfectly satisfactory bait, and
don&rsquo;t you forget it!&rdquo; declared Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet the fish swallow those worms so greedily
our arms will ache pulling them in so fast,&rdquo; added
Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>While the boys prepared the fishing tackle and
dug the bait, Aunt Betty saw to it that an ample
lunch was prepared, and by the time the girls
came down, dressed for the trip, everything was
in readiness.</p>
<p>They made their way down to the shore of the
lake, and a cry of surprise and delight broke from
the lips of the girls when they caught sight of the
motor boat.</p>
<p>For it was a new, a rejuvenated, <i>Water Sprite</i>
that met their eyes. She had been dowdy and
disreputable when she had taken them out on the
first trip. But the boys had made several surreptitious
trips to the nearest town, and had come
back laden with sundry cans of paint and varnish.</p>
<p>They had worked like troopers, painting the
boat from stem to stern, varnishing the deck and
the interior of the cabin, and cleaning every bit
of the brass work until it shone like gold.</p>
<p>The <i>Water Sprite</i> was a perfect picture now,
as she floated gracefully at the end of the little
pier, her ivory white coat of paint contrasting
beautifully with the rich brown of the deck tints
and her name showing in gold letters on her
stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a darling?&rdquo; exclaimed Bess ecstatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dream!&rdquo; asseverated Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what you boys have been up to on
these mysterious trips of yours, is it?&rdquo; asked Cora,
shaking her finger at them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Caught with the goods,&rdquo; grinned Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty, with extenuating circumstances,&rdquo; admitted
Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We throw ourselves on the mercy of the
court,&rdquo; laughed Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained Jack, &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t seem the
right thing to us that such pretty girls should sail
in such a shabby boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all I have to say is that you boys are
perfect darlings to go to all this trouble for us,&rdquo;
declared Bess emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;An ivory shallop, silken-sailed,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>quoted Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except that there are no sails,&rdquo; laughed Cora.
&ldquo;But the ivory part is all right. Really, girls, it
looks almost too pretty to use. Talk about Cleopatra&rsquo;s
barge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was only one queen on that, while we
have three,&rdquo; grinned Walter. &ldquo;But come along,
girls. I want you to catch those fish, so I can
show you what a peach of a cook I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls went on board in high glee, Paul cast
off the moorings, Jack started the engine to chugging,
and Walter this time took charge of the
wheel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>The <i>Water Sprite</i> darted off proudly, as though
conscious she was looking her best. The boys had
not been content with mere decoration, but had
made a thorough job of fixing the hull as well,
and this time there was no danger of wet feet.</p>
<p>They went down the lake some distance, and
then Jack stopped the engine, and the <i>Water
Sprite</i> floated about lazily, while they baited the
hooks and threw out the lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a bite,&rdquo; said Jack suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo; asked Walter solicitously.</p>
<p>Bess giggled, and the others joined in when Jack
hauled up a lot of dripping weeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Izaak Walton had nothing on you as a
fisherman,&rdquo; chaffed Paul.</p>
<p>But the laugh was on him a moment later, when
a voracious pickerel made off with his hook and
sinker, and he ruefully pulled up his broken line.</p>
<p>Cora was the first to score, landing a big flopping
perch to an accompaniment of little squeals
from Bess and Belle.</p>
<p>From that time on the luck was good, and before
long they had a number of perch and pickerel,
together with enough bass to supply all they
needed for an abundant dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re pretty well fixed now,&rdquo; said Jack,
as he eyed the pile of fish. &ldquo;What do you say
now to hustling along and giving Walter a chance
to make good on that frying proposition? I
think he&rsquo;s bragging, if you ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You do, eh?&rdquo; retorted Walter. &ldquo;If you clean
the fish as well as I cook them there&rsquo;ll be nothing
left to ask for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started up the boat again, and before long
were near the end of the lake. They went along
slowly, trying to find the special place that Cora
had referred to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; she exclaimed at length. &ldquo;See!
Right in that little cove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to a little indentation in the shore
where the trees had thinned out so as to leave an
open space carpeted with velvety, springing turf.
Near by, a tiny promontory extended into the
water, and here it was deep enough for the <i>Water
Sprite</i> to float without touching bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lovely spot!&rdquo; exclaimed Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little bit of Eden,&rdquo; seconded her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a dandy place to land,&rdquo; commented Jack.
&ldquo;We can fasten a rope to that tree and step
ashore without having to wade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys helped the girls ashore, and followed
them, bringing along their catch.</p>
<p>While the girls emptied the contents of the
lunch basket and spread the good things about in
a shady spot, Walter gathered some wood, dug a
hole in the ground and lighted a roaring fire. As
the flames died down he carefully raked the embers
into the hole, until he had a small furnace
that gave forth an intense heat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Then he prepared a skillet of oak twigs dexterously
twisted together, and was ready. Jack and
Paul in the meantime had been cleaning the fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, you common laborers,&rdquo; ordered
Walter in a lordly tone. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep an artist
waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fish-head whizzed past his ear and he hastily
sought refuge behind a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad shooting,&rdquo; he taunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough to make you duck,&rdquo; retorted
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While these rough-necks are disturbing the
peace,&rdquo; drawled Walter, &ldquo;it might be a good idea
to get some of those blackberries up there.
They&rsquo;ll come in handy for dessert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to a group of bushes about a hundred
feet distant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; volunteered Belle, rising to her feet.
&ldquo;You girls go on getting things ready. This lunch
basket is empty now and I&rsquo;ll take it along for the
berries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started to pick busily, while Walter, taking
the fish that had been cleaned, began to broil them
over the fire.</p>
<p>A delicious, tantalizing savor rose from the oak
skillets, and promised to justify all that Walter
had claimed for his cooking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, Belle!&rdquo; called Cora. &ldquo;Walter&rsquo;s
nearly finished now, and we&rsquo;re all ravenous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in a minute,&rdquo; sang out Belle,
&ldquo;but there&rsquo;s one big bush here that&rsquo;s just dying to
be picked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved toward it, but stopped in fright as
she heard a grunt and snort on the other side of
the bush.</p>
<p>The next instant she found herself looking into
the eyes of a big black bear!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">THE GREEDY MARAUDER</span></h2>
<p>For a moment Belle stood paralyzed with
fright.</p>
<p>The bear gazed at her unwinkingly, and his hair
began to rise slowly on his head as he gave vent
to a savage growl.</p>
<p>Then Belle screamed wildly, dropped her basket,
which was half full of berries, and ran towards
the other members of the party, who had risen and
rushed to meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; they cried in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bear!&rdquo; shrieked Belle, pointing to the thicket.
&ldquo;Oh, run, run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at this moment the bear emphasized the
wisdom of this advice by shambling into full sight.</p>
<p>The boys each possessed themselves of the arm
of one of the girls and hurried them to the boat.
They put them aboard, rapidly untied the rope
that held the <i>Water Sprite</i>, and themselves jumped
in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Then with a united push they sent the <i>Water
Sprite</i> away from the bank, Jack started the engine
going faster than he ever had before, and in
a moment more they were fifty feet out on the
lake.</p>
<p>Then only did they dare to draw breath.</p>
<p>It was perhaps lucky for them that Belle had
dropped her basket right in the path of the bear.
The piles of luscious fruit that had rolled out
proved a temptation too strong to resist. He
nuzzled into them luxuriously, and when he raised
his head his nose looked as though it were dripping
with paint.</p>
<p>They had a good view of him now, and they
shuddered as they saw what a large and shaggy
specimen he was. The bear looked at them too
and snarled as if with disappointment at their
escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beauty, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; demanded Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a nightmare to me,&rdquo; observed
Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lucky that Belle saw him first and gave
warning,&rdquo; said Cora. &ldquo;It would have been nice,
wouldn&rsquo;t it, to have been sitting at lunch and have
looked up to see him standing beside us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what it means now to have your tongue
cleave to the roof of your mouth,&rdquo; said Belle, who
was pale and shaken. &ldquo;I thought I never would be
able to scream.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>The bear resumed his shambling gait and
meandered leisurely down to the pile of fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The robber!&rdquo; groaned Walter. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll clean
up the pile. To think I&rsquo;ve been cooking for that
old reprobate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to take it as a compliment,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;Just see how the old thief is wading into
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fish were indeed disappearing with magical
rapidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a magician,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s making
mutton of fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s well enough to joke,&rdquo; murmured Bess.
&ldquo;But what will we do if he eats all the rest of our
lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to grin and bear it,&rdquo; said Paul,
whose disposition to pun could not be overcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;ll be satisfied with the fish and
leave the rest of the food alone,&rdquo; remarked Cora
hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cheerful optimist,&rdquo; replied her
brother. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know much about a bear&rsquo;s
appetite. Besides, he must be awfully hungry,
otherwise he would run away&mdash;bears usually do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I only had a rifle here!&rdquo; said Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dynamite bomb would be good enough for
me,&rdquo; growled Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we anything on board we can soak
him with?&rdquo; groaned Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much, except some loose bolts and
nuts in the locker,&rdquo; answered Cora, &ldquo;and they
wouldn&rsquo;t do any good, except perhaps to aggravate
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might get his mind off the rest of the lunch,
anyway,&rdquo; replied her brother. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get a handful,
fellows, and bombard the old brigand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were all smarting for revenge, and they
equipped themselves with the missiles and began
to throw. Several of them hit the bear, but he
paid no attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re too far off,&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;The force
of the bolts is spent before they get to him. Back
up a little closer to the shore, Jack, and we&rsquo;ll have
a better chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;d better?&rdquo; asked Belle. &ldquo;He
might get stirred up and come after us. Bears are
good swimmers, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t catch a motor boat in a thousand
years,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;If it were a rowboat now,
it might be different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He backed up until the boat was within ten feet
of the shore. Walter threw a bolt with such accurate
aim that it caught the bear right on the end
of his nose.</p>
<p>He reared up with an ugly roar, and his little
eyes shot flames of fire at his adversaries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>He offered a fair mark as he stood erect, and
Jack had an inspiration. Hanging over the side
of the <i>Water Sprite</i> was one of the life-preservers,
the round type, a circle with a very large opening
in the center, so that it could be easily slipped
over the head.</p>
<p>Jack snatched it up and threw it with the motion
of a quoit-thrower. It covered the short intervening
distance and went over the bear&rsquo;s head,
settling on his neck and looking for all the world
like a gigantic ruff. It gave the animal a most
grotesque appearance, and the spectators roared
with laughter.</p>
<p>It was easier for it to go on than it was for the
bear to get it off, and his antics were comical as
he rubbed his head against the trees and, failing
in that, took his paws to it. He succeeded at last,
but his naturally surly nature had not been improved
by the operation, and the instant the life-preserver
was dislodged, he rushed to the edge of
the shore and plunged into the water.</p>
<p>The action was so sudden that the party was
taken by surprise. The girls screamed, and the
boys had to do some quick work to get the <i>Water
Sprite</i> under way. They succeeded, however, and
once the engine was going, it was an easy matter
to keep out of the bear&rsquo;s reach, although for so
clumsy a creature he swam with amazing swiftness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>They could have distanced him without trouble,
but with deliberate purpose Jack kept just far
enough ahead of him to encourage him in thinking
that he might overtake his quarry. In this way,
he drew him down along the shore of the lake for
more than half a mile. By that time, Bruin&rsquo;s
ardor had cooled and his strength began to fail.
He gave a wrathful snort and made for the shore.</p>
<p>The instant he did so, Jack turned the boat
about and made all speed back to the place where
they had been surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s our chance, fellows,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
can get there long before the bear does, even if
he makes a bee line for it as soon as he gets to
shore. I&rsquo;ll hold her bow against the bank, while
you jump out and gather up the provisions and
bring them on board. That thief may have got
our fish, but he won&rsquo;t have the laugh on us altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very quick work that Paul and Walter
did, for they had no mind to be caught there when
the bear should make his way back, as they had no
doubt he would. They regained the life preserver,
which was so scratched and torn that it was no
longer good for its original purpose, but they
wanted it as a memento of the adventure.</p>
<p>As the bear had not had time to meddle with
the food laid out by the girls, they were not so
badly off after all, although it was exasperating to
have to go without the fish, whose appetizing
aroma was still in the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just when they were done to a turn, too,&rdquo; said
Walter gloomily. &ldquo;I wish the old rascal had
choked on the bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having recovered everything else, even to Aunt
Betty&rsquo;s lunch basket, the picnic party pushed out
some distance, and ate their lunch with an appetite
that was the keener for their enforced waiting.</p>
<p>They were sure that Bruin&rsquo;s instinct would lead
him straight back to the succulent repast that had
been so rudely interrupted, and they were right,
for a few minutes later he came loping along and
plunged into the remnants of his fish dinner. He
glared out over the water at his enemies, but his
one experience had been sufficient, and he made no
further attempt to take after them. He sniffed
around disappointedly at the place where the other
eatables had stood, and then lumbered away into
the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">THE DRIFTING BOAT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s gratitude for you,&rdquo; observed Jack.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve given that bear a perfectly good dinner&mdash;even
cooked it for him&mdash;and the only thanks we
get is an attempt to kill us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;we must forgive the old
fellow. Bear and forbear, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think it was so funny,&rdquo; remarked
Cora, &ldquo;if he&rsquo;d gotten away with the rest of the
lunch, as well as the fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even then we needn&rsquo;t have gone hungry,&rdquo; returned
Paul soberly. &ldquo;The forest preserves are
all around us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even in the cities, one needn&rsquo;t starve if he has
a sweet tooth,&rdquo; added Walter. &ldquo;He always has
the subway jams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; said Cora, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a pity the bear
didn&rsquo;t get you boys after all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We</i> may get <i>him</i> yet,&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
willing to let those fish of mine go unavenged.
Perhaps we can get some guns from Joel and
round this old fellow up. It certainly would do
me a lot of good to have his skin for a rug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have his own ideas about that,&rdquo; replied
Bess. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better let well enough alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see we&rsquo;re not the only ones on the lake,&rdquo;
remarked Cora, pointing to a small boat about a
mile away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some fellow out fishing in a rowboat,&rdquo; pronounced
Jack, after a moment&rsquo;s examination.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down that way and see what luck he&rsquo;s
having.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be fishing,&rdquo; observed Belle,
as the <i>Water Sprite</i> turned in the direction of the
rowboat. &ldquo;In fact, he seems trying to attract our
attention. There, he&rsquo;s waving at us. Let&rsquo;s hurry.
Perhaps he&rsquo;s in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack sent the <i>Water Sprite</i> flying at full speed,
and the distance between the boats rapidly narrowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; cried Belle, &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s
Mr. Morley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; acquiesced Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any oars in his boat,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though he were adrift,&rdquo; remarked
Walter.</p>
<p>When he was within a few yards, Jack shut off
the engine, and the <i>Water Sprite</i> drifted lazily
down alongside the rowboat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>It was indeed the botanist, and he smiled cordially,
if a little sheepishly, as they shouted greetings
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad to see you young people,&rdquo; he
returned. &ldquo;I rather thought it was your boat, but
she looks so gay in her new coat that I wasn&rsquo;t
sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your oars?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thereby hangs a tale,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Morley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come aboard and tell us all about it,&rdquo; replied
Cora. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fasten your boat to the stern and
pull it along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Morley climbed on board, helped by willing
hands, and Walter secured the rowboat by a
rope round a cleat in the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a simple story,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Morley.
&ldquo;Indeed, simple is the only word that properly
expresses it. The fact is that I rowed over to
the other side of the lake to find some specimens
that I had reason to think were growing there. I
got them all right and rowed back to the island.
I put the oars out of the boat on the dock, and
was going to get out myself, when something
peculiar about one of the specimens attracted my
attention, and I sat down in the boat to examine it
more closely. I got so engrossed in it that I forgot
everything else. Then suddenly I woke up to
the fact that the boat had drifted away from the
dock, and I was in the middle of the lake without
oars. I was trying to paddle with my hands, but
wasn&rsquo;t accomplishing much, when your boat came
in sight. I&rsquo;m always glad to see you young folks,
but I don&rsquo;t mind admitting that I&rsquo;m especially glad
to see you to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we are to see you,&rdquo; returned Cora
warmly. &ldquo;How lucky it was that we made up our
mind to spend to-day on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take you right over to your island,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully good of you,&rdquo; returned Mr. Morley.
&ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t interfere with any other
plans you may have made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; answered Cora. &ldquo;As a matter of
fact, I was going to ask Jack to stop at the island
before we went home to-night. I wanted to scold
you for not having come over to see us at Kill
Kare, as you promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to be scolded,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Morley.
&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been, however, because I didn&rsquo;t want
to come. But I&rsquo;ve had a very painful and difficult
problem that I&rsquo;ve felt I must solve and that
has taken up all my time. But I shall certainly
give myself the pleasure of calling before long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have had some very stirring adventures
of your own since I saw you last, I understand,&rdquo;
he continued. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I hear about
your being lost in the woods and rescued by an
aeroplane, Miss Kimball?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; smiled Cora, and she gave
him some of the details. &ldquo;But how did you come
to hear anything about it?&rdquo; she asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was talking with Mr. Baxter recently and he
told me about it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Morley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Baxter!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora in surprise.
&ldquo;We know him very well and he was very kind
and helpful while the search was going on. But
I didn&rsquo;t know that you were acquainted with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing some special work for me,&rdquo; Mr.
Morley explained, &ldquo;and we often have occasion
to consult together. He&rsquo;s a very clever man in his
particular line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora would have given the world to ask just
then what Mr. Baxter&rsquo;s line of work was, but she
felt that she might be prying. She waited expectantly,
hoping that the botanist would mention
it of his own accord, but he did not, and they were
soon talking of other things.</p>
<p>Of course they told him of their adventure with
the bear, and he laughed heartily at the way the
brute had made away with their fish dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he didn&rsquo;t leave you enough,&rdquo; he said heartily,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be very glad to have you come up to the
cabin with me and let me knock you up a meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we had plenty without the fish,&rdquo; laughed
Cora. &ldquo;But thank you just the same. And by
the way, we&rsquo;re going to have an outdoor spread on
the lawn at Kill Kare before long, in recognition
of the kindness of those who tried to bring the
prodigal daughter out of the wilderness. I expect
that your friend Mr. Baxter will be there, and I&rsquo;d
dearly love to have you come, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve fixed on the exact date, let me
know, and I certainly will,&rdquo; replied Mr. Morley.
&ldquo;But here we are now, and there are the oars
lying on the dock as a proof of my foolishness,&rdquo;
he added with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put me under a great obligation,&rdquo; he
said in parting. &ldquo;I might have drifted along the
greater part of the day, and perhaps the night,
before I touched shore somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One good turn deserves another,&rdquo; returned
Jack, &ldquo;and we haven&rsquo;t forgotten how royally you
helped us on the day the <i>Water Sprite</i> got into
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waved to him as the boat drew away and
shaped its course for Kill Kare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty lucky we came along, just the
same,&rdquo; observed Belle. &ldquo;Suppose, by any chance,
he had drifted ashore and found our friend the
bear waiting for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he without any oars in his boat,&rdquo; added
Bess, with a little shudder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">THE GYPSY CAMP</span></h2>
<p>Cora sat in a brown study as the boat hummed
its way to the home landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A penny for your thoughts, fair lady,&rdquo; said
Walter, as he lounged lazily on the cushions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Cora, &ldquo;I was wondering what were
the special business relations between Mr. Morley
and Mr. Baxter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to tell,&rdquo; replied Walter lightly. &ldquo;Perhaps
Mr. Baxter is an author or an illustrator,
and they&rsquo;re getting up a book together on botany,
or something of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think it&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; put in Jack. &ldquo;I told
you before that I thought he was a detective, and
something that he said when Cora was lost makes
me believe it all the more. He said that he knew
the authorities in some of the towns, and they&rsquo;d
be glad to oblige him. That sounds to me more
like a detective than an author talking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It does for a fact,&rdquo; agreed Paul. &ldquo;But what
do you suppose a detective and Mr. Morley have
in common?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morley said that Mr. Baxter was doing
some special work for him and that he was very
clever,&rdquo; said Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morley may have been robbed, and he
may be trying to trace the robbers,&rdquo; suggested
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were only that, there wouldn&rsquo;t be much
romance or interest about it,&rdquo; mused Cora. &ldquo;But
I have an idea it&rsquo;s something more intimate and
personal than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that a robbery is a pretty personal
and intimate thing,&rdquo; laughed Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cora means that there&rsquo;s a heart interest somewhere
in Mr. Morley&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; put in Bess, &ldquo;but of
course you boys are too sordid to understand anything
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they passed the barn on their way to the
bungalow they met Joel, who had just put up his
horse. He seemed a bit out of sorts, and as this
was unusual for him, it attracted their attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Joel?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuthin&rsquo; much,&rdquo; answered Joel. &ldquo;But I jest
heerd thet them pesky gypsies hez pitched their
camp over near Wilton, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s kinda rubbed my
fur the wrong way. I won&rsquo;t hev an easy minute
till I know they&rsquo;ve packed up their kits an&rsquo; hit
the trail again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The gypsies!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora. &ldquo;I wonder if
it is the same camp we saw before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s likely,&rdquo; returned Jack. &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t usually more than one camp in the same part
of the country. They spread out pretty thin and
keep apart. Besides, this fits in with the old
pirate we saw the other day. He was prospecting,
all right, and he picked out the vicinity of
Wilton because he saw good graft in the town and
the big hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure the news is straight?&rdquo; asked
Paul. &ldquo;How did you hear about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thet Baxter feller wuz drivin&rsquo; by, an&rsquo; he told
me,&rdquo; replied Joel. &ldquo;Wuss news I&rsquo;ve heerd in a
dog&rsquo;s age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if the news disgruntled Joel, it gave immense
satisfaction to the rest of the party, especially
the girls. They restrained their jubilation,
however, until they got beyond Joel&rsquo;s hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it darling!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll
have a chance to see that gypsy girl again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the good it will do you,&rdquo; jeered Walter.
&ldquo;That old horse thief will be on the job again,
and keep her from talking with you. For some
reason he seems to have it in for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drive over to-morrow,&rdquo; suggested Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like nothing better,&rdquo; agreed her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give Joel a pleasure and take him along,&rdquo;
put in Walter with a wicked grin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It would make him froth at the mouth just to
look at them,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;I guess in the interest
of the public peace we&rsquo;d better keep Joel as
far away from them as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to make that girl talk!&rdquo; declared
Cora emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a very hard thing as a rule,&rdquo; chaffed Walter.
&ldquo;The difficulty is usually to keep the girls
from talking. But these gypsies are a canny lot.
For some reason or other they&rsquo;re suspicious of us,
and they&rsquo;ll keep their eyes on us as long as we&rsquo;re
in camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in disguise,&rdquo; laughed Paul. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make
up as a clown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be any disguise,&rdquo; jabbed Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to hold you for a while, old man,&rdquo;
laughed Jack. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s go in to supper. I&rsquo;m
ravenous. We&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to think of
the gypsies later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day was bright and clear, and shortly
after lunch the cars were brought out and the
party of young people started for Wilton.</p>
<p>There was a fairly good road most of the way,
but there were patches that led through the woods
that were rather rough, and over these the cars
had to move more slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose that bear of ours should turn up
now,&rdquo; suggested Walter, as they passed through
an especially dense portion of the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it,&rdquo; shivered Bess, looking
fearfully on either side. &ldquo;What on earth would
we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run for it, I guess,&rdquo; replied Paul laconically.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d have to be pretty fast to overtake us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose he jumped out in front of us,&rdquo;
said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d have to put on full speed ahead and
bump him,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be as surprised
as the bull that tried to throw the locomotive off
the track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And about as badly mussed up, I imagine,&rdquo;
added Walter.</p>
<p>But at the same time he reflected that it might
have been just as well to have brought Joel&rsquo;s rifle
along, and in his secret heart he was relieved when
the cars got out again on the open road.</p>
<p>They slowed up a little as they drew near Wilton,
and scanned narrowly both sides of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess eagerly, pointing
to a large opening in the woods a little to the
right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; acquiesced Belle. &ldquo;I can see the vans
through the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re not the only visitors, either,&rdquo; remarked
Jack, as they caught sight of a number of
well dressed people walking about the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; replied Cora. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t
be so conspicuous, and the gypsies will be so busy
with the crowd that they&rsquo;ll take no special notice
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left their cars under the shade of some
trees and mingled with the throng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give them credit for having picked out a
good place,&rdquo; remarked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to be doing a land-office business,&rdquo;
observed Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that old fellow around that has such
a grudge against us,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably off somewhere cheating some farmer
in a horse trade,&rdquo; grinned Jack.</p>
<p>They passed a group of rather fast-looking
young men, who were talking and laughing loudly,
and Bess suddenly plucked Cora by the sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look now,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;but after
we get behind that clump of trees, take a look at
that crowd we&rsquo;ve just passed. There&rsquo;s an old
acquaintance of yours there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora did as directed and gave a start of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the man who tried
to steal my purse!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">A TANGLED SKEIN</span></h2>
<p>Belle followed Cora&rsquo;s gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough,&rdquo; she ejaculated, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s that man
Higby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose he&rsquo;s doing here?&rdquo; wondered
Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s off on his vacation,&rdquo; hazarded
Bess. &ldquo;Likely enough he&rsquo;s stopping at one of the
boarding houses in Wilton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girls seem to be hypnotized,&rdquo; laughed
Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get jealous if you keep looking at
those chaps any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see that man over there?&rdquo; asked Cora,
indicating Higby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow with the rainbow tie?&rdquo; asked Jack.
&ldquo;Yes, I see him. What of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man who tried to scrape acquaintance
with us, and nearly got my purse later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to pick a quarrel with him and punch
his head,&rdquo; said Jack savagely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do anything of the kind, Jack Kimball,&rdquo;
warned Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s our hated rival, is it?&rdquo; asked Paul,
looking at the young man with some amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have his heart&rsquo;s blood,&rdquo; hissed Walter
tragically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very queer,&rdquo; mused Cora. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
remember, girls, how the gypsy girl nearly fainted
when Bess happened to mention Higby&rsquo;s name?
And here he is now in the same camp with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be near by when they meet,&rdquo; remarked
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still looking for a mystery,&rdquo; chaffed Walter.
&ldquo;It beats all how you girls can pounce on trifles
and make a mountain out of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them an ounce of fact and they&rsquo;ll get a
ton of romance,&rdquo; agreed Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not asking for your approval,&rdquo; retorted
Cora. &ldquo;This is a case that requires brains
and naturally you boys are all at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that you&rsquo;ve reached harbor anywhere,&rdquo;
drawled Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; admitted Cora, &ldquo;but that doesn&rsquo;t
say we won&rsquo;t. I wonder where that girl can be,&rdquo;
she continued, as she looked searchingly around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;ve sent her over to Wilton to
tell fortunes there,&rdquo; suggested Paul. &ldquo;These gypsies
don&rsquo;t wait for business to come to them. They
hunt it up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora. &ldquo;The only
reason I cared to come over here was to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But although they loitered about the place for
another hour or two, they saw no trace of the
gypsy girl.</p>
<p>They were agreeably surprised, however, to
run across Mr. Baxter, with whom their relations
had grown cordial since he had exerted himself
so strenuously in the search for Cora. But despite
the pleasant footing on which they stood,
there was still that baffling sense of reticence that
enveloped him in everything concerning himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over to get your fortune told?&rdquo; asked
Jack with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Baxter, &ldquo;though I&rsquo;m
always in the market for exact information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mean to imply that there&rsquo;s
anything phony about the dope they hand out
here,&rdquo; laughed Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw your friend, Mr. Morley, yesterday,&rdquo;
remarked Cora.</p>
<p>Mr. Baxter shot a sharp look at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;How did you happen
to know we were acquainted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me so himself,&rdquo; returned Cora
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that ought to be pretty good authority,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Baxter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>But he showed no disposition to pursue the subject,
as Cora had wished he would, and the conversation
turned into other channels.</p>
<p>Mr. Baxter excused himself shortly, and the
party strolled on. The girls bought bits of bead
and embroidered work from the women, and had
their fortunes told twice, spinning out the time in
the hope that they would meet the girl they sought.
But she did not appear, and at last they made
their way to the cars, sorely disappointed.</p>
<p>They had gone only a little way when Bess
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! There&rsquo;s some one behind those bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others looked, but could see nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dreaming, I guess,&rdquo; remarked her
sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind!&rdquo; replied Bess indignantly.
&ldquo;I have eyes. And it was a woman, too.
I caught a glimpse of her skirts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose it is,&rdquo; observed Jack nonchalantly.
&ldquo;She has a right to be there if she wants
to. The woods are free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d get down and see,&rdquo; pleaded Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; replied Jack resignedly.
&ldquo;Since you girls are determined to butt in, I suppose
I&rsquo;ll have to be the goat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got down from the car, but at that moment
the bushes parted, and a girl stepped out into the
road. She was gaily dressed and had a tambourine
in her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>But there was no suggestion of gaiety in her
face, which was distressed and bore traces of recent
tears.</p>
<p>Cora uttered an exclamation of surprise and
pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the gypsy girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked up and tried to smile, but it was
a forlorn attempt.</p>
<p>The girls stepped down from the car and gathered
about her. The boys would have followed,
but Cora interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys drive on a little way and wait for
us,&rdquo; she directed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be with you in a few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys looked at each other and laughed,
but they obeyed. Then Cora turned to the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be in trouble of some kind,&rdquo; she
said gently. &ldquo;I wonder if we couldn&rsquo;t help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gypsy hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; urged Cora. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all
girls together here, and we&rsquo;ll do anything we can
to help you if you&rsquo;ll only let us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl started to speak in her gypsy patter,
and here Cora hazarded a bold stroke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk that way,&rdquo; she said with a winning
smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can use as good English
as we can if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shot went home, and the girl flushed under
the tan that bronzed her cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you think that,&rdquo; she said in
a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was from something you said the other day
when you were off your guard,&rdquo; replied Cora.
&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t want to meddle with your affairs,
but I do want that we should be friends.
My name is Cora and this is Bess and this Belle.
What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call me Nina,&rdquo; replied the girl, who was
visibly melting under the charm of Cora&rsquo;s personality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now won&rsquo;t you tell us just what the matter
is?&rdquo; continued Cora. &ldquo;I can see that you have
been crying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was frightened,&rdquo; answered the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the gypsies treat you badly?&rdquo; asked Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Nina. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re rough sometimes,
but they&rsquo;re kindly at heart. But there was
some one over at the camp to-day that I haven&rsquo;t
seen for a long time, and that I hoped I never
would see. I&rsquo;m afraid of him. He didn&rsquo;t see me,
but I saw him, and I ran away to hide in the woods
till he should be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls looked at each other, and the same
name came to the minds of all three.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">THE KNOCKING AT MIDNIGHT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know his name,&rdquo; said Cora quietly.</p>
<p>The girl looked at her in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you know?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you nearly fainted the other day when
you heard it mentioned,&rdquo; returned Cora, &ldquo;and we
saw that same man over at the camp to-day. His
name is Higby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl started violently, but whether she
would have admitted it they did not know, for
just at that moment a call came from the depths
of the woods:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nina, Nina!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My people are looking for me!&rdquo; exclaimed
Nina. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do for them to find me here
talking with you. They&rsquo;re suspicious of everybody.
I&rsquo;ll have to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must see you again,&rdquo; said Cora. &ldquo;We
simply must. Can&rsquo;t you come over to our place
and have a long talk with us? We live at Camp
Kill Kare, only about four miles from here.&rdquo; And
she hastily gave the needed directions for finding
the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Again the cry arose from the woods, but nearer
this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nina, Nina!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will come,&rdquo; said Nina hurriedly.
&ldquo;But you had better not come over to the camp
again. If they suspect anything they will shut me
up in one of the vans until they go away. Good-bye,&rdquo;
and she scurried away into the woods.</p>
<p>The girls looked after her regretfully and then
climbed into their car and drove ahead to where
the boys were waiting for them with more or less
patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how did you amateur sleuths make out?&rdquo;
asked Jack, as they drew alongside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foiled again, judging from their faces,&rdquo; observed
Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The committee reports progress and asks to
be continued,&rdquo; chimed in Walter in his best parliamentary
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought only women were curious,&rdquo; said
Belle scathingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys drive on,&rdquo; directed Bess. &ldquo;This is
a matter for us girls to settle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re clearly in the second-fiddle class,&rdquo;
grumbled Jack, as he threw in the clutch and took
the lead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it the most exasperating thing?&rdquo; observed
Bess, as the girls settled down for a
&ldquo;comfy&rdquo; talk. &ldquo;Just as we were on the very
point of finding out perhaps about that Higby, she
had to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness knows when we&rsquo;ll see her again, if
ever,&rdquo; sighed Belle pessimistically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad she has the Kill Kare address anyway,&rdquo;
replied Cora. &ldquo;She may come over to see
us. But if she doesn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll find out some way of
getting in touch with her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as Walter said, the committee has made
some progress anyway,&rdquo; said Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see where,&rdquo; put in her sister. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t really know any more of her story than we
did before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not of the real story, perhaps,&rdquo; admitted
Cora, &ldquo;but we know some things now, where formerly
we only suspected them. We know, for instance,
that Higby is the man she&rsquo;s afraid of. She
didn&rsquo;t actually admit it, though I think she was
about to, but his being there to-day and her hiding
make it practically certain. It just couldn&rsquo;t be a
mere coincidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then too,&rdquo; Cora continued, &ldquo;we know that
she can speak perfect English when she wants to.
And she has the accent of an educated girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t prove she isn&rsquo;t a gypsy,&rdquo; said
Belle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard sometimes of gypsy fathers,
especially the chiefs of tribes, sending their daughters
to good schools. I suppose at the time they
intend to keep them away from gypsy surroundings
altogether. But then the wild feeling in their
blood comes out and they drift back to the camp
life again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that happens sometimes,&rdquo; agreed Cora
thoughtfully, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s very rare, and all the
chances are against it&rsquo;s being true in this particular
case. And then, too, the blue eyes the
girl has show that she isn&rsquo;t of gypsy birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even if that is true,&rdquo; objected Belle, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see what good we can do the girl by getting
mixed up in this. If she&rsquo;s with the gypsies, she
may be there of her own accord. She seems to
be treated well enough. She didn&rsquo;t say anything
about wanting to get away from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t had time to tell us very much yet,&rdquo;
answered Cora. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re letting the boys get
too far ahead of us,&rdquo; and she put more speed into
her car and soon caught up with them.</p>
<p>The next day the rain came down in torrents.
It beat in a perfect deluge on roof and windows,
and even swept in on the big capacious porch, so
that outdoor life of any kind was out of the
question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>But it could not dampen the high spirits of the
party at Camp Kill Kare. They had been so constantly
on the go that the little interval of forced
inactivity was not after all unwelcome. The girls
were able to catch up with neglected bits of sewing.
Then there was the library stocked with
choice books, and one of the girls read aloud
while the others worked.</p>
<p>The boys ensconced themselves in the barn with
Joel, where the old backwoodsman regaled them
with stories of his adventures in the earlier days
when he had been one of the most noted guides
in the Adirondack region.</p>
<p>After supper a big wood fire blazed on the open
hearth and took the edge from the damp chill that
sought to invade the house. The girls furnished
music, and boys and girls together sang songs until
they were tired.</p>
<p>The girls had been asleep for an hour or more
when Cora was awakened by a knocking on the
front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who on earth can that be at this hour of the
night?&rdquo; she wondered, as she raised herself on her
elbow to listen.</p>
<p>The knocking continued, and as nobody else
seemed awake to answer it, Cora slipped out of
bed, donned a kimono, and softly woke Bess and
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Belle drowsily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away and let me sleep,&rdquo; murmured Bess,
turning over on her pillow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody knocking at the front door,&rdquo;
explained Cora. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down to see who it
is, and I want you girls to go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a burglar!&rdquo; exclaimed Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might get hurt!&rdquo; protested Bess, wide
awake now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; laughed Cora. &ldquo;Burglars don&rsquo;t
usually announce their coming by knocking at the
door. Besides, I&rsquo;ll find out who it is before I
open. Slip on your kimonos and come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They obeyed, not without some inward shrinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you ought to wake the boys?&rdquo;
asked Belle, hesitating on the landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do that without waking the whole
house, Aunt Betty and all,&rdquo; answered Cora. &ldquo;Besides,
the boys would have the laugh on us and
try to patronize us. We don&rsquo;t want to be looked
on as a lot of cowards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of the sisters seemed to be perfectly willing
just at that moment to be included in that
ignominious category, but they were accustomed to
follow where Cora led, and they went down the
stairs, their slippered feet making no noise.</p>
<p>The knocking still continued, though it seemed
weaker than at first.</p>
<p>Cora, with her lighted bedroom candle in her
hand, softly approached the door, which was secured
by a double lock and also by a heavy chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please let me in,&rdquo; came in a woman&rsquo;s voice
from outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Cora repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nina,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Oh, please let me
in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora unfastened the chain and turned the key,
and as she opened the door the gypsy girl staggered
into the bungalow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">FALSELY ACCUSED</span></h2>
<p>The Motor Girls caught the gypsy girl as she
was about to fall and seated her in a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor, poor thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out in this pouring rain!&rdquo; ejaculated Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And drenched to the skin!&rdquo; added Bess.</p>
<p>The newcomer presented a pitiable appearance.
Her gaudy apparel was torn and bedraggled, her
wet hair clung about her face, and she was gasping
with exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to come!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;I was afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora had formed her plans with quick decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must keep this to ourselves for to-night,
girls,&rdquo; she said in a low voice. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d be miserable
and embarrassed if the boys should come
down. We&rsquo;ll tell them all about it to-morrow.
The first thing to do is to get her up in our rooms
and give her some dry clothes. Then we&rsquo;ll get
her something to eat and drink and put her to
bed. She can tell us her story later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are so good!&rdquo; exclaimed the gypsy
girl, covering her face with her hands.</p>
<p>As quietly as they could, they helped her up the
stairs and rummaged in their closets for towels
and clothes. Then they all set to work, and in a
little while the newcomer was dry and warmly
dressed in civilized garments.</p>
<p>She was of about the same size as Cora and
Belle, and they had no trouble in fitting her out.
Bess would have been equally willing to contribute
some of her belongings, but her &ldquo;plumpness&rdquo; forbade.</p>
<p>It was astonishing to see the difference wrought
in Nina by the assumption of the garments of ordinary
life. She looked in them, as Belle remarked,
&ldquo;to the manner born,&rdquo; and when they had dressed
her hair in the way they wore their own, there
was little trace of the gypsy left, except her
bronzed complexion.</p>
<p>She gave a little cry of feminine delight as they
made her look at herself in the mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s so long since I wore clothes like
these!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Cora, as she gazed with pleasure
on the transformation that had been wrought,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll all go down to the kitchen and see what we
can get in the way of something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>They stole downstairs and the girls ransacked
the larder. They found plenty of cold meat and
bread and preserves. Belle got out a chafing dish
and scrambled some eggs, and Cora brewed a
pot of fragrant coffee. Bess set the table and
they all gathered about it and ate heartily.</p>
<p>The girls thrilled with the romance of it all.
The drenching storm, the midnight hour, the gypsy
visitor, the feeling that they were involved in a
mystery made them tingle. Then, too, the knowledge
that all this was taking place while the other
occupants of the house were unconscious of it gave
a touch of the surreptitious and the clandestine
that was not without its charm.</p>
<p>The gypsy girl of course was somewhat self-conscious,
as she could not help being under the
peculiar circumstances, but the girls noticed that
her table manners were good, and they were more
and more confirmed in their conviction that she
was not what her dress and surroundings had
made her appear.</p>
<p>She spoke mostly in monosyllables and only
when addressed, and every once in a while they
could see the look of anxiety and fear come into
her eyes that they had noted the day before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cora at last, when they had finished
sipping their coffee, &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better get
up to bed. You need a good night&rsquo;s rest,&rdquo; she
continued, addressing their guest, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll fix
you up a bed in our rooms. In the morning you
will be in better shape to tell us all you care to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you ought to know all about me before
you do that,&rdquo; replied Nina. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair to you.
Perhaps after you have heard why I came you
may regret taking me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never be sorry for that,&rdquo; declared Cora
emphatically; &ldquo;and I feel sure you&rsquo;ve never done
anything you ought to be ashamed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nina&rsquo;s face glowed with gratitude at the generous
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I never have!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been
accused of doing it, and that sometimes in the
eyes of the world amounts to nearly the same
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had dropped all pretence to gypsy speech
now, and spoke like any other American girl of
good breeding and education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll tell you now,&rdquo; she cried impulsively.
&ldquo;That is, if you&rsquo;re not too tired to hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; answered Cora, who was inwardly
delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just dying to hear it, to tell the truth,&rdquo; said
Bess frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; echoed her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; began Nina, &ldquo;in thinking that
I am not a gypsy. I am an American girl and I
was born in this State. And my name isn&rsquo;t Nina
either. But it will have to do for the present,
because until this matter is cleared up, I don&rsquo;t
want to tell my real name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My mother and father died when I was quite
young, and I went to live with an uncle. He was
an unusual man, and though no doubt he was fond
of me in a way, our natures were too different
for us to get along well together. I was hot
tempered and hasty and we often quarreled. It
was after an exceedingly bitter quarrel that I made
up my mind that I would run away from home
and earn my own living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a position in a department store, with
just enough pay to keep body and soul together.
Again and again I was tempted to go back and
make things up with my uncle. But that silly
pride of mine kept me from doing it. Oh, how I
wish I had!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There had been a number of thefts in the
store, and the manager was furious. He told all
the employees that the next one who was caught
would be sent to jail. Up to that time he had
usually been content with discharging them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day I was called to his office and accused
of having picked up a lady&rsquo;s purse that had been
laid on a counter. A man who was employed in
the store said that he had seen me take it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was frightened nearly to death, for I had
never even seen the purse. But it was found
lying under my counter, as though I had hidden
it there. I cried and begged and protested, but
it did no good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You poor child!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora, deeply affected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The manager must have been a brute!&rdquo; cried
Bess indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he thought I was really guilty,&rdquo; said
Nina, &ldquo;and he was exasperated by the many other
thefts. I thought I should go mad. He took up
the telephone to call for a policeman, and in that
minute when his back was turned I slipped out of
the door down the stairs and into the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some way I got into the outskirts of the town,
where I found a camp of gypsies. I don&rsquo;t remember
much after that. I suppose I must have collapsed.
But they took me in and nursed me, and
when I came to consciousness again some days
afterward, I found that the caravan had moved
on and was in a strange town a good way off from
Roxbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roxbury!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I had been employed,&rdquo; went on
Nina. &ldquo;When I found myself lying in a gypsy
van, with an old woman taking care of me, I did
a lot of hard thinking. With the gypsies I was
safe. Nobody would think of looking for me
there. But anywhere else I was likely to be arrested
at any minute. And I would rather have
died than gone to jail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So I stayed on with them and learned to tell
fortunes. I didn&rsquo;t know what else to do, and
gradually I got used to it. But I&rsquo;ve never been
really happy there. And I&rsquo;ve watched everybody
who came to the camp, for fear he might be an
officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora reached over and took the girl&rsquo;s hand
comfortingly in her own.</p>
<p>Quick tears evoked by the sympathetic action
sprang to Nina&rsquo;s eyes, but she brushed them away
and went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never met anybody I really knew until yesterday.
Then I saw a man whom I had known in
Roxbury. That&rsquo;s the reason you found me hiding
in the woods. I was relieved when I went back
to find that he had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to-day he came upon me unawares, and he
knew me through all my gypsy disguise. He
threatened to expose me, to hand me over to the
police. I was wild with fright. You had been
kind to me and I thought of you. I waited to-night
till the camp was asleep, and then I slipped
out. And here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">COUNCIL OF WAR</span></h2>
<p>The girl had told her story in such a simple
and straightforward way that, combined with the
candor in her eyes, it carried conviction to the
sympathetic hearts of her hearers. And their eyes
were moist as they listened to the pelting of the
rain and thought of the fugitive making her way
through the lonely woods, her footsteps dogged
with terror.</p>
<p>She sat looking from the eyes of one to the
other, and was comforted by what she saw there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor, dear girl!&rdquo; cried Cora, springing
up and giving her an impulsive hug. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had
an awful time of it, but we&rsquo;re going to do our best
to straighten things out and make you forget your
troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we know who the rascal was that
threatened you,&rdquo; said Bess. &ldquo;It was that man
Higby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the one,&rdquo; admitted Nina.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You say that he used to know you in Roxbury,&rdquo;
put in Belle. &ldquo;Was he employed in the
same store with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only that,&rdquo; returned Nina, &ldquo;but <i>he was
the man who said that he saw me take the purse!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He, of all men!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess. &ldquo;When I
saw him in the very act of slipping back Cora&rsquo;s
purse after he had taken it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should he have tried to put the theft
on you rather than anybody else?&rdquo; asked Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he had a grudge against me,&rdquo; answered
Nina. &ldquo;He had been too familiar in his manner
toward me, and I resented it. He was angry and
told me that I would be sorry. But I don&rsquo;t think
that would have been enough to make him go as
far as he did. He worked in the same part of the
store that I did, and I have thought since that
perhaps he took the purse himself. Then, when
the search for it was coming close to him, he got
scared, and slipped it under my counter so that
the blame would fall on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cur like that oughtn&rsquo;t to be allowed to live!&rdquo;
cried Bess in hot indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> that he stole it,&rdquo; qualified
Nina; &ldquo;but his eagerness to put the matter on
some one else makes me think he might have done
so. And even if he isn&rsquo;t a thief, he knew that he
was telling a falsehood when he said he saw me
take it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why should he threaten you now?&rdquo; asked
Belle. &ldquo;The whole matter has blown over long
ago as far as he&rsquo;s concerned, and he&rsquo;s in no further
danger. I can understand how the coward might
have lied in a moment of fright to save his own
skin. But why should he be cold-blooded enough
to keep on persecuting you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got some purpose in view,&rdquo; replied Nina,
&ldquo;and he wants to make me help him by threatening
to expose me if I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know what it
is, but from what I know of him I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s
something wrong. He said he&rsquo;d see me again tomorrow
and tell me his plan. I told him I
wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with him or his
plans, but he only grinned and said he guessed I&rsquo;d
rather help him than go to jail. I ran away from
him then, and later on I made up my mind to
come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did just exactly right,&rdquo; declared Cora.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take care of you until everything is made
all right. But you&rsquo;ll have to keep close to the
house, so that nobody besides ourselves will know
you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the gypsies?&rdquo; asked Belle. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
they make a search for you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they will,&rdquo; answered Nina. &ldquo;You
see,&rdquo; she said with a little pitiful smile, &ldquo;they regard
me as one of their assets. I make a good
deal of money for them from the visitors to the
camp. But apart from that, some of them are
really fond of me, and I feel the same way toward
them. They took me in when I was in extremity,
and in their way they have been kind. I never
want to go back if I can help it, but I will always
have a feeling of gratitude and affection for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you ought,&rdquo; returned Cora. &ldquo;But all
the same your natural place is with your own
people, and you mustn&rsquo;t have your life spoiled.
We&rsquo;ll set things in motion the first thing to-morrow
morning&mdash;or rather this morning,&rdquo; she
smiled, as she looked at her watch. &ldquo;Good gracious,
girls, it&rsquo;s after two now! We simply must
get to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They put out the light and stole upstairs, where,
after bestowing Nina comfortably, they were soon
sound asleep.</p>
<p>But Cora was astir early, for she wanted to
forestall the appearance of Nina at the breakfast
table by notifying Aunt Betty and the boys of all
that had happened in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miracle!&rdquo; cried Jack, as he came down the
stairs three steps at a time, followed by Paul and
Walter. &ldquo;Cora is up before the rest of us!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Fair goddess of the rosy-fingered dawn,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>quoted Walter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You boys stop your nonsense now and listen
to me,&rdquo; smiled Cora. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something very
important to talk over with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new fall styles, perhaps,&rdquo; chaffed Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the gypsy girl,&rdquo; began Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gypsy girl!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, pressing his
hand to his brow. &ldquo;Where have I heard that name
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s upstairs sleeping,&rdquo; said Cora simply.</p>
<p>The effect was electric. The young men
dropped their foolery at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Jack, staring at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking!&rdquo; cried Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she get here?&rdquo; queried Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came last night about twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; replied
Cora, quietly enjoying the shock she had
given. &ldquo;I heard her knocking at the door, and
got up and let her in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you call us?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to rouse the house,&rdquo; Cora answered.
&ldquo;I made sure that it was a woman before
I opened the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that might have been a trap,&rdquo; reproved
Walter. &ldquo;She might have had confederates with
her who would have forced their way in as soon
as the door was opened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that,&rdquo; admitted Cora. &ldquo;I
knew it was Nina&mdash;that&rsquo;s the name she goes by&mdash;and
I took her in. The poor thing was drenched
from head to foot and was nearly frightened to
death. We gave her dry clothes and something
to eat and put her to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then to the boys and to Aunt Betty, who
had entered while they were talking, Cora told in
detail what she had learned of the gypsy girl&rsquo;s
story.</p>
<p>The others listened intently, breaking in frequently
with questions. Aunt Betty was full of
sympathy, though a little dubious about this new
element brought into the life of Kill Kare.</p>
<p>The sympathies, too, of the boys were aroused,
though their feelings took the form of bitter indignation
against Higby. They would have
jumped at the chance to form a vigilance committee
and thrash him within an inch of his life,
if it could have been done without disagreeable
publicity for the girls.</p>
<p>As to the mystery itself, they were not as keenly
interested as the girls were in solving it. They
had a masculine hatred of seeming to pry, and
they foresaw a whole lot of possible complications
in the presence of the newcomer. But after all,
their chivalry was aroused by the girl&rsquo;s plight, and
they cheerfully promised to do all they could to
get her out of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;On general principles I object to Kill Kare&rsquo;s
becoming an orphan asylum,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;But
you can count on us, sis, to take off our coats and
work like beavers to set things right. Eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; replied Walter in his somewhat
slangy manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch our smoke,&rdquo; prophesied Paul, and
grinned broadly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">A NARROW ESCAPE</span></h2>
<p>Cora, greatly relieved now that things had been
explained to the rest of the household, went upstairs
to find that the other girls were up and
nearly dressed.</p>
<p>Nina presented a very different picture from
that of the night before. No one looking at her
would think that she was different from any other
girl who might be staying as a guest at Kill Kare.
In a pretty white dress that Belle lent her, she
looked charming.</p>
<p>She was naturally diffident and nervous at the
prospect of meeting Aunt Betty and the boys.
But their good breeding and kindness of heart
smoothed over all difficulties. They laughed and
jested at the table as usual, including her at times
in the conversation, but taking care not to make
her feel conspicuous. By the time the meal was
over, they had succeeded very materially in putting
her at ease.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>For the benefit of the servants, it was given
out that Nina was a friend who had arrived rather
late the night before, and might stay at Kill Kare
for some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope that Joel doesn&rsquo;t get wise,&rdquo; remarked
Jack, when he was alone with his chums.
&ldquo;I can imagine the old boy throwing a fit if he
learns that we&rsquo;re harboring anybody connected
with the gypsies. He loves them as much as a
miser loves a tax collector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll catch on,&rdquo; replied Walter;
&ldquo;but if he does we&rsquo;ll tell him that our keeping
her here is making the gypsies sore. That&rsquo;ll
square things with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be a good thing for one of us
to run over to the gypsy camp to-day, to see if
that Higby is hanging around,&rdquo; suggested Paul.
&ldquo;We might get a line on where he&rsquo;s staying and
how long he&rsquo;s likely to be in the neighborhood.
And then, too, we might be able to see whether
Nina&rsquo;s absence has raised much of a stir in the
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get my hands on that Higby&rsquo;s
throat,&rdquo; growled Jack. &ldquo;Of all the unspeakable
cads, he&rsquo;s the limit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He sure is,&rdquo; agreed Paul. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll have to
put on the soft pedal if we hope to find out anything.
I&rsquo;ll try to strike up an acquaintance with
him, ask him for a match, or something like that.
He&rsquo;s a shallow rascal, and it ought to be easy to
worm something out of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Detective,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;Suppose
you take that part of the work on you. In
the meantime, I&rsquo;ll write a letter to Tom Willis,
an old college pal of mine and Walter&rsquo;s, who lives
in Roxbury, and ask him to make some discreet
inquiries about that matter of the theft. Tom&rsquo;s
a good old scout and he&rsquo;ll be glad to do anything
he can for us. I want to find out whether a warrant
was actually issued for the girl. If it wasn&rsquo;t,
the girl is all right, and Higby can&rsquo;t make good
on his threats. If it was, we&rsquo;ll have to get a lawyer,
and try to have it quashed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to find out whether a warrant
was issued for her, if you don&rsquo;t know her
name?&rdquo; asked Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; replied Jack, a little dashed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go and have a talk with Cora. Maybe she can
get the girl to tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a result of his hurried conference, Cora
spoke to Nina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack wants to look up that old matter at Roxbury,
Nina, and he can&rsquo;t do it unless he knows
the date and also your name,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t want to pry, but you can see yourself that
we can&rsquo;t do much if we go groping round in the
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It happened a year ago last May,&rdquo; replied
Nina, &ldquo;and the name to look for is Helen Holman.
It isn&rsquo;t my real name, but it was one that
I chose to take when I was afraid my uncle would
be hunting for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t feel quite ready yet to tell me
your real name?&rdquo; inquired Cora kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t ask me yet,&rdquo; pleaded Nina.
&ldquo;When once I know that there&rsquo;s no danger of disgracing
it, I&rsquo;ll be glad to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora did not press her, but returned to Jack
with the information he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sis,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By the way, are
you girls planning to use your car to-day? If not,
Paul would like to drive over to the gypsy camp
in it. Walter and I want to take my car over to
the garage in town to-day to have a few repairs
made. These roads have played the mischief with
the tires. Besides, I want to lay in a stock of
gasoline. I noticed this morning it was running
low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t want to use my car to-day, and
Paul&rsquo;s perfectly welcome to it,&rdquo; replied his sister.
&ldquo;And if you&rsquo;re going over to Milford I wish you&rsquo;d
bring back some things we&rsquo;re short of for the
spread. You know that comes off to-morrow
night. I&rsquo;ll give you a list of the things we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>But an hour later, when he and Walter drove
off, his mind was so full of the measures he meant
to take in behalf of Nina that he forgot all about
Cora&rsquo;s list.</p>
<p>She herself did not remember it until Jack had
been gone for an hour or more. And by that time
Paul had driven off in her car to the gypsy camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora in deep vexation,
&ldquo;how could I have been so careless? We
just can&rsquo;t get along without those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for a lark let&rsquo;s go over to Milford ourselves,&rdquo;
suggested Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And walk?&rdquo; asked her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Bess. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done as
much walking as I ought to lately, and it&rsquo;s a great
thing to help me reduce. Besides, I don&rsquo;t believe
it is more than four miles, and it&rsquo;s a splendid day
for walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might follow the railroad through the
cut,&rdquo; said Cora. &ldquo;That takes off some of the distance.
Come ahead, girls, and let&rsquo;s do it. We&rsquo;ll
probably get there before the repairs are finished
on the car, and we&rsquo;ll give the boys a surprise
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle agreed after a little more urging, and the
girls put on their hats and sallied forth, leaving
Nina in charge of Aunt Betty, with strict injunctions
not to show herself at any of the windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>At a distance of a mile and a half from Kill
Kare ran a single track, narrow-gauge railroad
that served a number of tiny towns scattered
through that region. It was a leisurely, go-as-you-please
affair, and, as a railroad, was considerable
of a joke. The rolling stock consisted of
a couple of locomotives that had seen better days
and a string of dilapidated cars that had been discarded
on other roads. Time schedules were honored
in the breach rather than in the observance,
and one or two trains a day each way wheezed
along at their own sweet will.</p>
<p>But it served as a short cut to Milford, and
the girls chose to go by way of it on that account,
and also because it ran through a sort of gorge
that cut off the hot rays of the sun.</p>
<p>But if it was delightful overhead, as much could
not be said for the walking underfoot. The ties
were split and irregular, and the slag that lay between
them was trying to the feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sorry for any stranded actors who ever
have to walk these ties,&rdquo; complained Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s smoother on the outside of the track
than where you&rsquo;re walking,&rdquo; suggested Cora.
&ldquo;Suppose you try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a switch in the track just at that
point, and as Belle tried to step over the rail as
Cora had suggested, her foot slipped and was
caught in the frog.</p>
<p>She would have fallen to her knees if Cora had
not caught and steadied her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hurt yourself?&rdquo; asked Bess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only scraped my ankle a little,&rdquo; answered her
sister. &ldquo;But I may have ruined a perfectly good
shoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to pull her foot from the frog, but
found that she could not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull a little harder,&rdquo; urged Cora.</p>
<p>Belle tried again, but with no success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sole seems to be caught in a spike or something,&rdquo;
she explained.</p>
<p>Bess gave a little scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hurry, hurry,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Suppose a
train should come along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just at that instant they heard a long shrill
whistle from up the track.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">WAYLAID</span></h2>
<p>A scream broke from all the girls, and Belle
nearly fainted.</p>
<p>They could not see more than a hundred feet up
the track, for at that point the road curved round
a bluff. But they could see a column of smoke
rising high in the air and the humming of the
rails grew steadily louder.</p>
<p>Cora was pale as death, but she rose to the
emergency and took command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run up the track as fast as you can, Bess,&rdquo; she
directed, &ldquo;and wave your hands to the engineer to
stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bess was off at once and Cora turned to Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have plenty of time, dear,&rdquo; she said soothingly,
&ldquo;if you do exactly as I say. Keep your foot
perfectly still while I unlace your shoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By a great effort of will, Belle did as she was
told, leaning her hand for support on Cora&rsquo;s
shoulder as the latter knelt at her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Bess rushed madly up the track and around the
curve, and her eyes dilated with horror as she saw
the train, now only a few rods away.</p>
<p>She screamed wildly and waved her hands frantically.</p>
<p>Her voice could not be heard above the rattle
of the train, but fortunately her signals were seen
and the engineer shut off the steam and put on the
brakes.</p>
<p>With a great hissing and clamor the train swung
round the curve and bore down upon the girls.</p>
<p>Cora had been working desperately, but her
fingers seemed to fumble with the laces as though
she were in a nightmare. But she steadied herself
and finished her task. Then she sprang to
her feet and pulled with all her might, Belle aiding
her, and the foot slipped from the shoe, while
the girls fell back against the side of the gorge,
well clear of the track.</p>
<p>The train had slowed rapidly, but when it came
to a full stop it was not more than twelve feet
from the abandoned shoe.</p>
<p>The engineer and fireman jumped down and
rushed forward. A glance at the shoe told the
whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a narrow escape, ladies,&rdquo; remarked
the grizzled engineer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky I saw those
signals. I hope that you&rsquo;re not hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More scared than hurt,&rdquo; answered Cora.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you were scared,&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;but you were mighty plucky just the same. Lots
of girls would have lost their heads and just
screamed or fainted. I&rsquo;ll get this shoe out of the
frog for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed the shoe to Belle, and he and the
fireman clambered back in the cab. The train
was a freight, for which the girls were grateful,
as they were spared the embarrassment of a trainful
of passengers crowding around.</p>
<p>They rested a little after the train moved on,
for the strain, though brief, had been very great.
Then Belle resumed her shoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you had better go straight
home?&rdquo; asked Bess solicitously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess not,&rdquo; replied Belle, who was getting
back some of her color. &ldquo;Besides, we&rsquo;re much
nearer to Milford now than we are to Kill Kare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better go on,&rdquo; judged Cora.
&ldquo;The boys will bring us back in the car, and if
we should miss them, we&rsquo;ll hire a rig of some kind
to get home in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Bess will need it more than any of the
rest of us,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never ran so fast in my life,&rdquo; answered Bess.
&ldquo;If exercise is all that is needed for reducing, I
ought to have lost pounds,&rdquo; and she smiled, although
the smile was tremulous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>They were lucky to find the boys still waiting
at the garage, and the surprise of the latter at
their appearance was only equalled by their consternation
at the danger Belle had run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girls need a guardian,&rdquo; said Jack severely,
&ldquo;and Walter and I elect ourselves unanimously
for that position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty hard job,&rdquo; sighed Walter. &ldquo;Our
hair will be gray before our time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell Aunt Betty about this adventure,&rdquo;
warned Jack. &ldquo;She must be on the verge of nervous
prostration already, and this would just about
cap the climax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made the purchases for which Cora had
come, and drove rapidly back to Kill Kare.</p>
<p>They found that Paul had returned some time
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find out anything?&rdquo; asked Cora eagerly,
as she stepped from the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not such an awful lot,&rdquo; answered Paul. &ldquo;The
gypsy camp was certainly stirred up about something&mdash;little
knots everywhere jabbering away in
that outlandish lingo of theirs. Didn&rsquo;t seem as
keen on grafting from visitors as usual. I suppose
of course that Nina was the storm center. They&rsquo;re
pretty badly roiled, I imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about Higby?&rdquo; asked Bess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him, too,&rdquo; replied Paul. &ldquo;Jostled
against him, excused myself in my well known
irresistible manner, and got into conversation with
him. He&rsquo;s staying over at Wilton on a two weeks&rsquo;
vacation. He&rsquo;s used up nearly a week of it now.
Doesn&rsquo;t seem to be very keen about going back,
though. Knocks his job to beat the band. I guess
he&rsquo;s sore on the management.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the real reason is that they&rsquo;re sore
on him,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed the manager looked at him very suspiciously
the day that Cora lost her purse,&rdquo; observed
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s near the end of his rope and
knows it,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;He was quite anxious to
know how far we were here from the Canadian
line. He may be getting ready to emigrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be a great loss to the United States,&rdquo;
sniffed Bess contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could probably stagger along without
him,&rdquo; drawled Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he have anything to say about Nina?&rdquo;
asked Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in an offhand way,&rdquo; returned Paul. &ldquo;He
remarked that there seemed to be a great hullabaloo
among the gypsies, and that he understood
one of the girls was missing. But I noticed that
he kept looking sharply all around as though he
was hoping to see some one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s just one thing to do,&rdquo; remarked
Cora, &ldquo;and that is to keep Nina close inside the
house until the coast is clear. Higby will be gone
in another week, and the gypsies never stay long
in one place. And in the meantime we may get
word from Roxbury that will tell us what the next
step must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following night was the one set for the
celebration of Cora&rsquo;s safe return, and the weather
was all that could be asked for. The spread itself
was a great success. The girls had decorated the
lawn with strings of Chinese lanterns on lines that
swung from tree to tree, and the tables were abundantly
spread with food that both in quantity and
quality roused the enthusiastic appreciation of the
men from the sawmill, who composed the major
portion of the guests. Mr. Morley made a little
speech and Mr. Baxter came out of his shell long
enough to offer a witty toast to Cora and the
other girls. The boys sang some rollicking college
ditties, and the phonograph, brought out on
the porch, discoursed such music as was not commonly
heard in that remote region. It was a
jolly, sparkling evening that they all enjoyed, and
it was late when the gathering dispersed with three
rousing cheers for their hosts.</p>
<p>The days flew swiftly by until a week had
passed. Nina had fallen readily into the life at
Kill Kare and the girls had become greatly attached
to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>The danger that threatened her seemed to be
vanishing. The gypsies, after unavailing search
and inquiries that had reached as far as the bungalow,
had departed. Paul had motored over to
Wilton and found that Higby had left the place
where he had been boarding, and the presumption
was that he had returned to Roxbury.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances the restrictions that
had held Nina to the house seemed unnecessary.
Besides, she felt the confinement more on account
of the outdoor life to which she had been accustomed.</p>
<p>Soon she ventured into the woods round about,
though seldom going far from the house. But as
her sense of security increased, she occasionally
went farther. And one afternoon, when her temerity
had taken her far beyond her usual limit,
she turned a bend in the path and came face to
face with&mdash;Higby!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">THE PLOT</span></h2>
<p>The girl screamed and tried to run, but Higby
was too quick for her and seized her roughly by
the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going
to get away from me as easily as all that, after
I&rsquo;ve been watching you for days. You&rsquo;ve got to
listen to what I have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; cried the girl, pulling away from
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go where?&rdquo; he leered. &ldquo;To jail? You&rsquo;ll go
there mighty quick if I care to have you go. All
I have to do is to notify the police at Roxbury and
you&rsquo;ll be behind the bars in forty-eight hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned white as the awful vision that
had haunted her for a year past seemed to be
assuming form and substance. She had no doubt
that he could do as he threatened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo; she asked in a
trembling voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re getting a little more sensible,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;Sit down on that bank and I&rsquo;ll tell
you what I want.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those folks you&rsquo;re staying with are pretty
well off, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know where I&rsquo;m staying?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my affair,&rdquo; he said brusquely. &ldquo;I know
you&rsquo;re staying at a place they call Camp Kill Kare.
Quite a change from the gypsy camp,&rdquo; he sneered.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re flying high these days. But that&rsquo;s neither
here nor there. Those boys and girls there seem
to have plenty of money. There&rsquo;d be quite a haul
there in the way of cash and watches and diamond
rings and other jewelry, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grasped his meaning and drew away from
him in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you&rsquo;re thinking of
robbing the house!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty squeamish for a jailbird,&rdquo; he
sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a jailbird!&rdquo; she cried passionately. &ldquo;I
never did a dishonest thing in my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say differently at Roxbury,&rdquo; he taunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she blazed out. &ldquo;But why? Because
you told a falsehood about me! You know you
didn&rsquo;t see me steal that purse!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cut this short,&rdquo; he said impatiently.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put the whole thing in a few words. I&rsquo;m not
going back to Roxbury. I need money, and need
it bad! Those folks at Kill Kare have plenty of
it, or what can be turned into money, and I want
you to help me get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never will!&rdquo; she cried defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s either that or jail,&rdquo; he said menacingly.
&ldquo;And I know that you won&rsquo;t choose jail when you
come to think it over. I&rsquo;ll give you a day to
make up your mind. You be here at this same
time to-morrow, or it will be the worse for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pleaded with him to renounce his purpose
and leave her in peace, but he laughed at her and
went away with a parting threat.</p>
<p>Nina retraced her steps to the house in a state
of great agitation. She felt sure that Higby was
in desperate earnest and would denounce her to
the authorities if she should fail to do his bidding.
But she would have died before helping him
to rob her benefactors.</p>
<p>What resource then was left? Flight! Once
more to become a fugitive&mdash;to live under the ban
of the law&mdash;to fear any moment the touch of an
officer&rsquo;s hand upon her shoulder.</p>
<p>The castle of dreams that she had been building
in the last few happy days seemed ready to dissolve
in mist.</p>
<p>She tried to assume her usual cheerful manner
when she entered the house, but the girls noticed
at once that she was pale and anxious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Nina?&rdquo; asked Bess.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as white as though you&rsquo;d seen a ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you haven&rsquo;t run across any of the gypsies!&rdquo;
exclaimed Cora, in quick apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like that,&rdquo; Nina asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor Higby?&rdquo; asked Belle.</p>
<p>Nina faltered, and at this the others jumped to
their feet in great excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that that cur is lurking
around here yet?&rdquo; demanded Cora.</p>
<p>Nina broke down then, and told them all the
details of her meeting with Higby.</p>
<p>The girls were aghast at the plan to rob the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting along fast,&rdquo; remarked Belle bitterly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s graduating from the sneak thief to
the burglar class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what we ought to do,&rdquo; said Bess.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad the boys are away to-day. I suppose
the police ought to be told about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing yet to tell,&rdquo; said Cora. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
simply deny that he ever suggested anything of
the kind to Nina. It would be only her word
against his, and she has no witnesses. Besides,
for revenge, he&rsquo;d blurt out all about that Roxbury
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the maid announced a visitor,
and Nina vanished as Mr. Baxter entered the
room and greeted the girls cordially.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of an Adamless Eden here, I see,&rdquo; he
laughed, as he noted the absence of the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; smiled Cora, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re out for a spin to-day
by themselves. But I expect that they&rsquo;ll be
back before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather sorry they&rsquo;re not here,&rdquo; said Mr.
Baxter, &ldquo;as I wanted to talk over a matter in
which you&rsquo;re all interested. I refer to the young
lady who has been staying with you for the last
week or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the sickening fear came to Cora
that Mr. Baxter might be an emissary from the
Roxbury authorities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about her?&rdquo; she asked warily.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dear friend of mine who is paying me a
little visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not a very old friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Baxter
quietly, &ldquo;since two weeks ago she was telling fortunes
in a gypsy camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cry broke from the lips of the girls, and they
looked at each other in great trepidation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now,&rdquo; said their visitor with a genial
smile, &ldquo;she hasn&rsquo;t the slightest thing to fear from
me. In fact, I think I&rsquo;m going to prove one of
the best friends she has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; breathed Cora in relief, &ldquo;I hope you will!
The poor girl is sadly in need of all the help she
can get.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have been looking for her for a long time
past,&rdquo; said Mr. Baxter. &ldquo;At least I feel reasonably
sure that she&rsquo;s the girl I&rsquo;m after. And my
only object in finding her is to restore her to the
home and relative that she ran away from in a fit
of youthful anger. I suspected that I had found
her in Nina the gypsy girl. But now that I have
seen her dressed in civilized clothes and compared
her with the pictures in my possession, I feel practically
sure of it. Still, I won&rsquo;t know positively
until I bring her and my client face to face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; cried Cora, &ldquo;is your client&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there!&rdquo; Mr. Baxter checked her. &ldquo;No
names, please. If I am right in my identification
you&rsquo;ll know all about it before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can name him now,&rdquo; smiled Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never jump at conclusions,&rdquo; advised Mr. Baxter.
&ldquo;But what I called for especially to-day was
to warn you that your house was to be robbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we heard only a few minutes ago,&rdquo; replied
Cora. &ldquo;Thank you very much for the warning,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she told you?&rdquo; remarked Mr. Baxter with
a gratified smile. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. I am glad that
she has defied that fellow&rsquo;s threats. I was concealed
near by and heard the whole conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think we ought to do?&rdquo; asked
Cora.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; replied Mr. Baxter, &ldquo;that the girl
had better meet Higby to-morrow and pretend to
fall in with his plans. I will be on hand and hear
all he says. In the conversation that goes on between
them, Higby may say something that reveals
her innocence and his guilt in that Roxbury
affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can arrange to let him into the house at
night, which is evidently the part he wants her to
play in the theft. We&rsquo;ll be waiting for him when
he comes, and we&rsquo;ll give Mr. Higby the surprise
of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">BROUGHT TOGETHER</span></h2>
<p>The plan met with the hearty approbation of
the girls, and they accepted it, subject to the approval
of the boys.</p>
<p>And when the latter reached Kill Kare and
learned what was afoot, they agreed to it enthusiastically.
They all felt toward Higby as they
would toward a particularly noxious reptile. And
this latest attempt to make the victim of his falsehoods
a criminal brought their feeling of detestation
to the highest pitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t it do me good to get a whack at
him!&rdquo; gloated Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be as safe with me as if he were on a
battlefield,&rdquo; remarked Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix him!&rdquo; declared Paul.</p>
<p>Nina had been told that Mr. Baxter had overheard
the conversation with Higby, but had been
given no hint that the detective was looking for
her to restore her to her home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>At the appointed time on the following day,
she met Higby, whose face lighted up with an evil
smile as he saw her appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought better of it, did you?&rdquo; he remarked
jeeringly. &ldquo;I knew mighty well you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s vile of you to make me do a thing like
this,&rdquo; protested Nina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t so particular at Roxbury,&rdquo; he
taunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you harp on that?&rdquo; she cried furiously.
&ldquo;You know I didn&rsquo;t steal that purse. I
believe you did it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I did?&rdquo; he grinned mockingly, in a
way that was itself a half admission. &ldquo;I deserve
credit for being smart enough to make somebody
else the goat. But let&rsquo;s get down to business. I
want you to tell me all about the way the rooms
are laid out and where the cash and jewelry are
kept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him an idea of the plan of the bungalow,
and promised to leave a door open from the
back leading into the kitchen. He was to come a
little after midnight.</p>
<p>That afternoon and evening, life took its ordinary
course at Kill Kare, as far as external signs
were concerned. They knew that Higby was probably
watching the house from the shelter of the
adjoining woods, ready to take flight at anything
which might indicate the betrayal of his plans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>Not that he anticipated betrayal. He was confident
that the deadly fear that Nina had of jail
would keep her his accomplice, even though an unwilling
one. But one could never be too careful
when engaged upon such a venture as his.</p>
<p>He noted the girls sitting on the porch with
their sewing, or picking flowers in the garden, saw
the boys go motoring and return, heard the party
singing songs after supper on the steps of the veranda.
There was nothing to excite suspicion in
the slightest degree and he exulted as he thought
of the rich haul he expected to make.</p>
<p>His jubilation would have been less keen, however,
had he noted the care with which Joel loaded
his favorite revolver and had he seen three men
who slipped into Kill Kare under cover of the
darkness.</p>
<p>One of the three was an officer who had been
brought over from Milford to make the expected
arrest. The other two were Mr. Morley and Mr.
Baxter.</p>
<p>The botanist had been told of the robbery that
had been planned, and had been invited to be &ldquo;in
at the death.&rdquo; But he had not received the slightest
hint of the presence of Nina in the house. The
detective did not care to risk a possible disappointment.
Then, too, he had a sense of the dramatic,
and schooled himself to wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>As for Nina herself, she kept carefully out of
view, as she always did when there were visitors
at Kill Kare.</p>
<p>Eleven o&rsquo;clock was the usual hour of retiring at
the bungalow, and no deviation from the custom
occurred on that night. A few minutes after eleven
the lights were out, and Kill Kare seemed to be
peacefully sleeping.</p>
<p>The door at the rear had been left unlocked, as
arranged. The members of the party, all fully
dressed, waited in different rooms the outcome
of the drama.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably stop in the dining room to look
over the silver,&rdquo; remarked the officer, Thompson
by name, to Mr. Baxter. &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;d
better nab him then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in too much of a hurry,&rdquo; advised
Baxter. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably look for his biggest haul
in the sleeping rooms upstairs. Give him plenty
of rope and let him hang himself. Besides, the
farther he gets into the heart of the house, the
harder it will be for him to escape in case any of
our plans go wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were seated in the dark in their own
rooms, their hearts beating fast with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll be only lookers on,&rdquo; remarked
Bess in a low tone. &ldquo;The men will do all the
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rdquo; replied Cora. &ldquo;We
may come in somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was it you put in that cedar chest you&rsquo;re
sitting on?&rdquo; asked Belle curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later,&rdquo; replied Cora. &ldquo;And, girls,
stay right where you are, whatever happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dark she busied herself with something
at the entrance of the room.</p>
<p>Shortly after midnight, Higby slipped in through
the rear door. He had taken off his shoes and
was in his stocking feet.</p>
<p>It was pitch dark within, and he moved with
such feline stealthiness that he had reached and
stolen up the stairs before the watchers were sure
that he was not one of themselves.</p>
<p>The jewelry of the girls was the chief object
that he had in view, and he went to their rooms
first. But as he stepped inside, he tripped over
a wire that extended from one side of the door
to the other, at the height of a foot, and fell
headlong with a crash that jarred the house.</p>
<p>Cora reached into a chest, and clutching an
acetylene lamp that was already lighted, turned
its blinding glare right into Higby&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dare to move!&rdquo; she commanded.</p>
<p>Higby, not knowing how many weapons were
turned upon him, and unable to see anything in
that pitiless blaze, lay perfectly still. The next
instant he was in the grasp of the men and boys,
who handled him none too gently and jerked him
to his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Trapped by a woman!&rdquo; he growled, as he saw
the wire over which he had fallen and the lamp
that Cora still held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trapped all right,&rdquo; declared Thompson,
as he snapped a pair of handcuffs on his
wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in for a good long term in the State
Prison,&rdquo; added Mr. Baxter. &ldquo;We have you dead
to rights, Higby, and you haven&rsquo;t a show in the
world. But you may be able to have some years
cut from your term if you help now to undo a
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; muttered Higby, his craven soul
clutching at straws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That theft at Roxbury that you charged Helen
Holman with committing,&rdquo; Baxter reminded him.
&ldquo;You stole that purse yourself, didn&rsquo;t you? Speak
up now. Nothing but the truth will help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Higby, sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; remarked Baxter. &ldquo;Take
him away, Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a wild hubbub after the officer had
driven away to Milford with his prisoner. All
the boys and girls were laughing and talking at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this Helen Holman you were talking
of?&rdquo; asked Mr. Morley.</p>
<p>A sudden hush fell on Cora and the others, as
they listened for Mr. Baxter&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A girl that has lately been leading the life of
a gypsy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Baxter. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very interesting
character. Miss Kimball,&rdquo; he continued,
turning to Cora, &ldquo;will you ask Miss Holman to
step here for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora darted into the adjoining room, and returned
an instant later leading Nina.</p>
<p>She and Mr. Morley looked casually at each
other. A startled look leaped into the eyes of
each. There was a gasping cry, and the next instant
she was in his arms, sobbing as though her
heart would break, while he held her tight as
though he never intended to let her go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were sobbing openly, while Mr. Baxter
blew his nose vigorously, and even the eyes of
the rollicking boys were momentarily dimmed.</p>
<p>Mutual explanations followed, together with
mutual requests for forgiveness. Both had reaped
the bitter fruit of hasty tempers, and had been
made to realize during their separation how really
dear they were to each other. The reconciliation
was complete, and the Motor Girls were delighted
beyond measure at the part they had played in
bringing it about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>During the remainder of her stay at Kill Kare,
Alice Morley grew more and more deeply attached
to the girls to whom she owed so much,
and when she finally went back with her uncle to
Saxton, it was with the promise that she would
soon make a long visit to them at their homes in
Chelton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old Chelton!&rdquo; remarked Belle, as, shortly
after the departure of Alice, they themselves
turned their faces homeward. &ldquo;How glad I&rsquo;ll be
to get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Cora. &ldquo;But you must admit that
we&rsquo;ve never spent such a glorious outing as this
one at Camp Kill Kare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this delightful memory as their cherished
possession, we bid farewell to the Motor
Girls.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
